    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      Cygwin is a Unix-like environment that runs within a Microsoft
      Windows system.  It is free, open source software.
      Cygwin consists primarily of shell commands and
      applications from the GNU/Linux environment.  Because it 
      supports the complete GNU suite of software development tools,
      including compilers for C, C++ and Fortran, many applications 
      for the Linux environment can simply be transferred to 
      Cygwin in source code form, compiled, linked and run. 
      Because Cygwin supports 
      <command>sh</command>,
      <command moreinfo="none">perl</command>,
      <command moreinfo="none">python</command>
      and the 
      <command>cron</command> batch scheduling system, it is
      an excellent environment for batch production on
      a windows system.
      Most applications developed to run 
      in the Cygwin environment can be transferred to Linux or Unix
      with almost no changes.
    </para>
    <para>
      The first major application for the Cygwin environment by 
      the RFPK Software Team is a platform for testing SPK.
      Key portions of this application are written in the
      <command>perl</command> and
      <command>sh</command> scripting languages.  This tutorial
      describes the process of installing Cygwin on a Windows 
      machine for developing or running this or similar applications.

    <title>Downloading and Installation</title>
    <para>
      The software can be downloaded for free over the Internet, from
      the
      <ulink url="http://www.cygwin.com/">
	<emphasis>Cygwin</emphasis>
      </ulink>
      web site.
    </para>

	  On the Cygwin home page, press the
	  <command><guilabel>Install Now</guilabel></command> icon.
	</para>
	<para>
	  A window will appear, asking you to provide the path to
	  a directory into which to download 
	  <filename moreinfo="none">setup.exe</filename>, the
	  Cygwin downloading and installation wizard.  The
	  path of a temporary directory is recommended.

		Select Root Install Directory.
		Provide the name of a directory that will be large enough

		a bit of space, depending on what optional components
		you select in the steps that follow.  For example, the
		Cygwin installation on the author's workstation
		occupies about one gigabyte of space, and is contained

		This top category name, and all of the subcategory names,
		are followed by a directive which, initially, is
		  <command moreinfo="none"><guimenuitem moreinfo="none">
		    Default
		  </guimenuitem></command>.
		By clicking repeatedly on a directive, you can change
		it from
		  <command moreinfo="none"><guimenuitem moreinfo="none">

		  </guimenuitem></command> to
		  <command moreinfo="none"><guimenuitem moreinfo="none">

	      <para>
		If you want everything, all you have to do is change

		  <command moreinfo="none"><guimenuitem moreinfo="none">

		    Next
		  </guibutton></command> button to start the download.
 	      </para>
	      <para>
		If you want less than everything, you will need to 
		go to the individual categories and specify what 
		you want in addition to the defaults.  In general,
		a software developer will want at least the following:

    <title>Post Installation</title>
    <para>
      After the installation completes, start up a terminal 
      window by double-clicking the icon on the desktop.  You 
      should be started in your Cygwin home directory.  To 
      verify this, enter the following command after the 
      shell prompt:
      <screen format="linespecific">
	pwd
      </screen>
      The response should be
      <screen format="linespecific">
	/home/<emphasis>your-user-name</emphasis>
      </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      The default shell for Cygwin is
      <command moreinfo="none">sh</command>,
      the Bash shell, which is a 
      version of the original Bourne shell enhanced in
      several ways, including the addition of command-line
      history and editing.  For portability, it is
      important to always write shell scripts for
      <command moreinfo="none">sh</command> rather than for
      <command moreinfo="none">csh</command>,
      <command moreinfo="none">tcsh</command>,
      <command moreinfo="none">ksh</command>,
      or any other shell.  It is recommended that RFPK developers
      use <command moreinfo="none">sh</command> for all editing.
      including command-line editing, in order to eliminate
      confusion and because the current version has incorporated
      nearly all of the useful features that were pioneered by
      one or another of the above-named alternatives.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Bash shell uses several configuration files, that it
      will read when it starts up, if they are located in your
      home directory.  A brief description of these files
      follows.
      <glosslist>
	<glossentry>
	  <glossterm>.bash_profile</glossterm>
	  <glossdef>
	    <para>
	      <anchor id="login"></anchor>
	      Bash reads this file when you "log in."  With
	      Cygwin, you are, in effect, logging
	      in when you double-click the 
	      <guilabel moreinfo="none">Cygwin</guilabel> icon
	      on the desktop or in the 
	      <guimenuitem moreinfo="none">Start</guimenuitem> menu.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The primary use of this file is to define environment
	      variables.  For example, the 
	      <varname>PAGER</varname> environment variable tells
	      programs which paging command to use.  The default
	      is usually the <command moreinfo="none">more</command>
	      command.  Most people find, however, that the
	      <command moreinfo="none">less</command> command is superior.
	      You can instruct <command moreinfo="none">sh</command>
	      and other programs that query the 
	      <varname>PAGER</varname> variable
	      to use <command moreinfo="none">less</command> by
	      placing the following commands in your
	      <filename moreinfo="none">.bash_profile</filename>
	      <screen format="linespecific">
		PAGER=less
		export PAGER
	      </screen>
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Note that you should not depend on your
	      <filename moreinfo="none">.bash_profile</filename>
	      being read prior to execution of a shell script,
	      because the shell script might not be run from 
	      a log-in shell.  For example, there is no login
	      shell for scripts run by 
	      <command moreinfo="none">cron</command>.
	    </para>
	  </glossdef>
	</glossentry>
	<glossentry>
	  <glossterm>.inputrc</glossterm>
	  <glossdef>
	    <para>
	      This file is used to specify that you would like to
	      have the command-line editing feature enabled and
	      which mode of editing, either 
	      <command moreinfo="none">vi</command> or
	      <command moreinfo="none">emacs</command> you prefer.
	      For example, the following entry will provide
	      command-line editing that behaves like
	      <command moreinfo="none">vi</command>:
	      <screen format="linespecific">
		set editing-mode vi
	      </screen>
	    </para>
	  </glossdef>
	</glossentry>
	<glossentry>
	  <glossterm>.bashrc</glossterm>
	  <glossdef>
	    <para>
	      Bash reads this file whenever it is started interactively.
	      This occurs when you log in, as explained 
	      <link linkend="login">above</link>, or when an 
	      additional bash shell is spawned by a shell that is
	      already running interactively.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      The primary use of this file is to define aliases.
	      For example, the printer interface command,
	      <command moreinfo="none">lpr</command>,
	      may need a number of arguments to specify exactly
	      which printer to use.  If you always use the
	      same printer, you can redefine
	      <command moreinfo="none">lpr</command> with the
	      following alias:
	      <screen format="linespecific">
		alias lpr='lpr -P'\''Xerox DocuPrint N32 PS'\'''
	      </screen>
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Note that you should not depend on your
	      <filename moreinfo="none">.bashrc</filename>
	      file being read prior to execution of a shell script,
	      because the shell script might not be run from 
	      an interactive shell.  For example, there is no
	      interactive shell for scripts run by 
	      <command moreinfo="none">cron</command>.
	    </para>
	  </glossdef>
	</glossentry>
