 <h3>About Our University of Washington Certificate</h3>
 <p>
 This web site is hosted on a secure web server. When you first attempted to access this page, you may have been greeted by a pop-up window warning you that the security of the web site was suspect. The reason for this lack of trust is that our server certificate was issued by the University of Washington Certificate Authority rather than one of the commercial certificate authorities known to your browser.
 </p>

 <p>
 If you intend to be a repeat user of spk.rfpk.washington.edu, we recommend that you import the University of Washington <strong>root</strong> certificate into your browser. The process takes only a few seconds. After that has been accomplished, your browser will greet all certificates issued by the University of Washington Certificate Authority, and ours in particular, with the same degree of cordiality that it extends to commercial ones.
