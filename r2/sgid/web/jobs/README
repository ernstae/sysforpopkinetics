SGID IDENTIFIABILITY
====================

The jobs directory is where all runs will take place.  A separate directory will be created for each job run with the following naming convention

sgid-job-#

where # represents the ID number of the job as determined by the SGID database.

Jobs are "picked up" by the application "sgid_runqueue.php" which checks with
the database to see if there are any jobs in the "queue" status.

It is important to know that there may be multiple versions of sgid_runqueue.php running on your system at any given time.
