    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      A <emphasis>relational database</emphasis>
      plays a central role in the
      architecture of Spk, because it is the means by which the
      major independent components communicate with one another
      and because it is the basis for implementation of a 
      central feature of the design, known as the
      <ulink url="../jobHistory/jobHistory.html">
	Job History Model
      </ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
      In order to operate a relational database, it is necessary
      to have a
      <emphasis>relational database management system (RDBMS).</emphasis> 
      Because Spk will be distributed under an open source
      license, the open source MySQL RDBMS will be used.
      MySQL has all the features required by Spk and has a very
      large user base.
    </para>
    <para>
      All of the widely used RDBMS share many
      similarities.  They implement certain underlying concepts
      based on the work of E.F.Codd (see for example
      <ulink url="http://www.acm.org/classics/nov95/toc.html">
	A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks  
      </ulink>)
      and many others, which define
      what a relational database is and does.  They all 
      provide a high-level interface language known as
      the Structured Query Language (SQL). Most also provide
      standard vendor-independent interfaces based on popular
      programming languages such as C, Java, and Perl.
      These interfaces are known as Application Programming
      Interfaces (API). At a fundamental level, Spk will rely
      on these standard APIs so that it will be possible
      to substitute another RDBMS for MySQL, if necessary.
    </para>
    <para>
      In order to insure the integrity of the database as 
      information is added and modified, it is desirable to 
      limit interactions with the database to a small body of
      well-tested code.  For this reason, Spk includes
      its own high-level API, which caters directly to the
      needs of the MDA, Aspk and Cspk, and hence eliminates
      any need for these components to use the low-level
      APIs directly.  This Spk-specific API is the
      topic of this document.
    </para>
    <para>
      The functions of the Spk API are described
      in a language independent manner.  There are three
      language-specific implementations of the API, known
      as language <emphasis>bindings</emphasis>.
      The Spk Database API has a Java binding, a C
      binding, and a Perl binding to satisfy the needs of the
      MDA, the Aspk and the Cspk, respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
      This specification can be best understood with reference to
      the following related documents:

    <title>Usage Scenario</title>
    <para>
      When a user decides to run a set of scientific data against
      a model, she calls upon the Spk MDA running on her
      workstation to submit the model and data as a job.  The
      MDA transmits this information across the Internet to a 
      process known as the MDA Surrogate, which runs on a web
      server.  The MDA Surrogate then creates a job by adding
      a row to the <emphasis>job</emphasis> table of the database,
      with the model in the <emphasis>xml_model</emphasis> field
      and the data in the <emphasis>xml_data</emphasis> field.
      The <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> field of this new row
      is set to the value 'q2c'
      thus adding the job to the compiler queue. This queue is a 
      <emphasis>logical</emphasis> entity based on values 
      stored in the <emphasis>job</emphasis> table, rather than
      a <emphasis>physical</emphasis> entity in which records are
      added and deleted.
    </para>
    <para>
      Running independently, either on the machine that runs the
      web server or on some other machine, an idle
      Aspk Compiler queries the compiler queue by searching
      the <emphasis>job</emphasis> table for jobs with 
      <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> equal to 
      'q2c' and selects the
      one which has the
      highest priority.  In a logical sense, it removes the 
      job from the compiler queue when it changes the 
      <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> from
      'q2c' to 'cmp'.
      The job is not removed from the 
      <emphasis>job </emphasis>table, however.  Jobs are
      never deleted from this table. 
    </para>
    <para>
      The process by which the Aspk Compiler selects the highest
      priority job that has <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> equal
      to 'q2c' and changes the 
      <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to 'cmp' must occur atomically,
      because there may be several instances of the Compiler
      trying to do the same thing simultaneously. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Having selected a job to compile,
      the Aspk Compiler proceeds to transform the model source
      into the C++ language.  If it encounters errors, it
      adds an error report to the <emphasis>report</emphasis>
      field of the job, sets the <emphasis>state_code</emphasis>
      field to 'end' and the <emphasis>end_code</emphasis> field
      to 'cerr'.
      It is then idle and can scan for another job to compile.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the Aspk Compiler succeeds in compiling the model,
      it updates <emphasis>job</emphasis> by storing
      its output in the <emphasis>cpp_source</emphasis> field
      and changing the <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to
      'q2r'.  The Compiler is then idle and can scan
      for another job to compile.
    </para>
    <para>
      When a Cspk becomes idle, it queries the run
      queue by selecting the highest priority job which has
      <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> equal to 
      'q2r'.  It logically removes the job from
      the queue by setting the <emphasis>state_code</emphasis>
      to 'run'.  The selection and the changing of 
      state must occur as an atomic transaction, because 
      there may be another Cspk process trying to select
      the highest priority job at the same time.
    </para>
    <para>
      When the Cpsk has finished running the job, it updates
      the <emphasis>job</emphasis> table by storing the 
      results of the computation in the <emphasis>report</emphasis>
      field, setting <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to 'end'
      and <emphasis>end_code</emphasis> to 'srun'.
      The Cspk is then idle and can scan the queue for another
      job to run.
    </para>
    <para>
      The MDA via its MDA Surrogate, periodically queries the
      database to discover whether or not any of its user's
      outstanding jobs have reached the <emphasis>End</emphasis> state.  
      When it discovers that one has, it retrieves the 
      contents of the <emphasis>report</emphasis> field
      and presents them to the user.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Aborting Job</title>
    <para>
      When a user decides to abort a job, the MDA sets the 
      <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> field of the job row to indicate 
      that the job is aborted or should be aborted by one of the daemons. 
    </para>
    <para>
      If the current <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> is 'q2c', the MDA sets
      the job's <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to 'end' and the job's
      <emphasis>end_code</emphasis> to 'abrt'. 
    </para>
    <para>
      If the current <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> is 'cmp', the MDA sets 
      the job's <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to 'q2ac'.  The compiler 
      daemon visits the database every second.  When the compiler daemon  
      finds the job, it changes the <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to
      'acmp' and sends a termination signal to the process executing the
      compiler instance for the job.  When the process terminates, the 
      compiler daemon sets the job's <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to 'end' 
      and the job's end_code to 'abrt'.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the current <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> is 'q2r', the MDA sets
      the job's <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to 'end' and the job's
      <emphasis>end_code</emphasis> to 'abrt'. 
    </para>
    <para>
      If the current <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> is 'run', the MDA sets 
      the job's <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to 'q2ar'.  The run-time 
      daemon visits the database every second.  When the run-time
 daemon  
      finds the job, it changes the <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to
      'arun' and sends a termination signal to the process executing the
      SPK driver instance for the job.  When the process terminates, the 
      run-time daemon sets the job's <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to 'end' 
      and the job's end_code to 'abrt'.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the compiler daemon is shutdown in the middle of a job abortion,
      it may leave jobs with <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> 'q2ac' or 
      'acmp'.  When the compiler daemon is restarted,  it sets the job's
      <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to 'end' and the job's 
      <emphasis>end_code</emphasis> to 'abrt'.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the run-time daemon is shutdown in the middle of a job abortion,
      it may leave jobs with <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> 'q2ar' or 
      'arun'.  When the run-time daemon is restarted,  it sets the job's
      <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to 'end' and the job's 
      <emphasis>end_code</emphasis> to 'abrt'.  In the later case, there may
      be a checkpoint file in the working directory of the job.  The daemon 
      copies the text content of the checkpoint file to the database if there
      is one.

    <title>Functions</title>
    <para>
      In this section the individual API functions will be described.
      Although they are referred to as <emphasis>functions</emphasis> here,
      they are implemented as <emphasis>subroutines</emphasis> in the Perl
      language
      and as <emphasis>class methods</emphasis> in Java. The descriptions
      below define those properties that are independent of language binding.
