Feel free to tackle any of these or any other problems you find.  All
I ask is that you send me your changes so that they can be
incorporated into a common codebase for everyone to benefit from
(also, so you can get credit for your work!).

- rewriting the core of Shareable in C to gain speed and memory
efficiency.  (Update as of January, 1998: I am presently working on
this.  If anybody else has made progress in this area, please let me
know so our efforts can be coordinated.) (Update as of March, 2000: I
quickly ran out of tuits to complete the rewrite in C.  Maybe some
other time)

- perhaps add news ways to share data in addition to shared memory so
that the module becomes portable

- have Shareable print proper error messages when system calls fail

- really blue sky: could the module overload some operators so that
their use will automatically invoke locking and unlocking of a tie()d
variable?
