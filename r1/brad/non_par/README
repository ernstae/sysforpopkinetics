Conversion of Non-Parametric Population Analysis from Matlab to C++.

The documentation for the Octave / Matlab version is in 
	matlab/doc
The documentation for the C++ version is in
	cpp/doc

Step 0: Download and install mat2cpp.

Step 1: Execute the command
	./configure BOOST_DIR=<boost_dir> MAT2CPP_PREFIX=<mat2cpp_prefix>
where <boost_dir> is replaced by the directory where boost is installed
and <mat2cpp_prefix> is the prefix for the mat2cpp installation. If these
values are chosen correctly the following two files will exist:
	<boost_dir>/boost/numeric/ublas/matrix.hpp
	<mat2cpp_prefix>/include/mat2cpp.hpp

	(note to users who are installing SPK)
  	To install the non_par library with the SPK defaults, execute the 
	shell script:

	./build.sh spk

Step 2: Execute the command
	make

Step 3: Execute the commands
	cd matlab
	octave
	all_ok
	exit
	cd ..
the Octave program should respond that all the tests pass (you can use
Matlab in place of Octave).


Step 4: Execute the commands
	cd cpp
	./all_ok
	cd ..
the all_ok program should respond that all the tests pass.
