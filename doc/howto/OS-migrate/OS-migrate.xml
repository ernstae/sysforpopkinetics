    <title>Preparation</title>
    <para>
      In the future, it should be possible to migrate from one
      version of Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) to the next via
      an update process, in which most files in your system
      will remain intact. This is, unfortunately, not possible in the
      migration from Redhat Linux to RHEL.  Your entire disk 
      storage will be wiped clean.  It is, therefore, crucial that
      you prepare carefully for the move.

      <title>Get a Hard Copy of this Document</title>
      <para>
	If you have not already done so, print out a copy of this document
	from its <filename>.pdf</filename> file.

      <title>Verify the Backup of your Home Directory</title>
      <para>
	Each weekday night, your system should be copying your
	home directory to &whitechuck;. You should verify that
	this is working correctly.  Here is one way to do that:
	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      In a terminal window, go to the directory on
	      &whitechuck; which contains your backup copies:
	      <screen>
ssh whitechuck
cd backup
	      </screen>
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      If you run <command>ls -l</command>, you should see a
	      list of directory names, each starting with the date
	      on which the backup was taken. Go 
	      <command>cd</command> to the most recent backup, and
	      then take a directory listing:
	      <screen>
cd <emphasis>most-recent-backup</emphasis>
ls -lR $USER > /tmp/backup_listing
	      </screen>
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Open a terminal window on your workstation, and
	      make a similar directory listing there, retrieve the 
	      listing made on &whitechuck;, and use <command>diff</command>
	      to compare the two:
	      <screen>
cd ..
ls -lR $USER > /tmp/current_listing
cd /tmp
scp whitechuck:/tmp/backup_listing .
diff current_listing backup_listing
	      </screen>
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      If the backup is recent, the output from the 
	      <command>diff</command> command should be short. Check 
	      into any differences that come as a surprise.  At the
	      end of this process, you must be confident that your
	      backup is good.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Make a Copy of <filename>/etc</filename></title>
      <para>
	Most of the configuration files on your workstation reside in the
	<filename>/etc</filename> directory.  If certain functions 
	no longer work after the migration, it will be useful to be
	able to consult previous versions of the configuration files.
	From a terminal window, here is a convenient way to make
	a copy:
	<screen>
su -
cd /
tar cvzf /tmp/etc.tgz etc
chown $USER /tmp/etc.tgz
exit
scp /tmp/etc.tgz whitechuck:
	</screen>
	Upon completing the command sequence listed above,
	a new tar ball named <filename>etc.tgz</filename> should 
	appear in your home directory on &whitechuck;.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Plan the Migration of Non-RPM Packages</title>
      <para>
	The overwhelming majority of software packages on your workstation
	were installed by the Redhat Package Manager (RPM).  When
	you install RHEL, later versions of these packages will be
	installed automatically.  You may, however, have several 
	packages that were not installed by RPM.  These are most
	likely located in <filename>/usr/local</filename>, although
	they may be elsewhere.  Only you know what these packages
	are.
      </para>
      <para>
	There are two basic ways to handle the migration of
	your non-RPM packages:
	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Reinstall them from scratch.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Similar to the way that you placed a copy of 
	      <filename>/etc</filename> on &whitechuck;
	      place a copy of the tar ball for each package
	      somewhere safe, so that you can copy it back 
	      and expand it after the migration.  Note, however,
	      that this might not work, because the package 
	      might depend in some way on RedHat 8.0 that is 
	      not compatible with RHEL.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
	Just to be on the safe side, it might be best to make a 
	copy of any non-RPM package that you are really depending
	on, even though your intention is to reinstall from scratch.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Print Out Key Network Configuration Files</title>
      <para>
	The RHEL installation script will ask certain questions
	about your network configuration.  It will be useful
	to have printout of key files to refer to.  From a 
	shell window:
	<screen>
pr /etc/resolv.conf | lpr
pr /etc/hosts | lpr
pr /etc/sysconfig/network | lpr
pr /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 | lpr
	</screen>
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Commit your CVS Changes</title>
      <para>
	Be sure to commit any changes that you have made to 
	your CVS work space.
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Install RHEL from Cdrom</title>
    <para>
      There are five RHEL3 installation cdroms.  Of these, you will 
      probably only need the first three.  Important steps in the
      installation process are listed below.  Not all interactions
      with the installation GUI are covered, because many items
      are either obvious or you have simply to agree with something
      that the software has already figured out.  When in doubt,
      accept the value that the software suggests.
    </para>
    <para>
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Automatic Partitioning.  Your machine contains two hard 
	    drives. We <emphasis>do not</emphasis> want to remove

	    that currently contains Windows.  Be certain that you 
	    select the Windows drive for RHEL installation.

      at the top of the page:
      <screen>
whitechuck.rfpk.washington.edu/soft/index.html
      </screen>
      This should bring up the Software Team web page, from 
      which you can bring up a copy of this document..  In the
      steps that follow, having a copy on the screen will facilite
      entering commands into shell windows, because you can

    <title>Create Extra Directory</title>
    <para>
      The Software Team backup process places a copy of your
      entire home directory on &whitechuck; after each working
      day.  Sometimes you need storage for files which do not
      require nightly backup. This is a convenient way to 
      provide this storage in a way that is accessible with
      ordinary user permissions.
    </para>
    <para>
      In a shell window (note <command>su</command> is not followed

    <title>Install Copies of Your Old Home and Old Etc</title>
    <para>
      In order to simplify the task of restoring the functions
      that you enjoyed before the migration, you can copy the
      most recent backup of your home directory, and the 
      the copy you made of <filename>/etc</filename>
      from &whitechuck; to your workstation.
    </para>

      The following assumes that you have set up directory which is
      located outside of your home directory, but to which you have
      write privilege and to which there is a symbolic link called
      <filename>extra</filename> in your home directory.  For details,

      After completion of the previous

      <filename>old_home</filename> as a symbolic link to a
      copy of the most recent pre-migration backup of your home
      directory, you are ready to restore most of the contents
      of that directory.  To do this, we will use the
      <command>rsync</command> command, which gives us a convenient
      means of copying a directory tree while excluding a few
      things we do not want copied.  In particular, we do not
      want to overwrite the gnome and rhn settings that have just
      been set up.

    <title>Restore Static IP</title>
    <para>
      After the migration, RHEL communicated with a DHCP server in
      the UW network to get information to set up Internet access.
      This works fine, but at this point your machine is not
      accessible by name from the outside, because the IP that
      DHCP assigns can change every time you restart your network
      interface.  For the time being, at least, the Softwar Team
      workstations are accessible by host name from the Internet,
      because they have had static IP addresses assigned.  
    </para>
    <para>
      Do the following to restore your static IP address
      (note that <command>su</command> is not followed by the
      - option symbol):
      <screen>
su 
cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
cp ifcfg-eth0 ifcfg-eth0.bak

    <title>Restore Password-Free SSH Connections</title>

      If you have previously followed the instructions in the
      <emphasis>SSH Configuration Howto</emphasis> to enable
      your workstation to create secure connections to remote
      hosts without requiring a password except when your
      desktop manager starts up, you will want to follow the

    <title>Get New CVS Workspace</title>
    <para>
      At this point, you have a copy of your CVS workspace
      that was in the backup of your home directory.  If,
      as recommended by this document, you did a 
      <command>cvs commit</command> just before you started
      the installation and after the backup was made, the
      copy you now have is out of date. In order to get
      an up-to-date workspace, the easiest method is to
      delete the out-of-date copy and then do a
      <command>cvs checkout</command>.
