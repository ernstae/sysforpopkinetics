	You probably receive and send your ordinary email
	via the mail agent associated with your web browser
	or by logging into a &uw; Unix system such
	as <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">
	  homer.u.washington.edu
	</systemitem> and
	running <command moreinfo="none">pine</command>.
	There is another type of mail which is important for anyone
	who writes operational software and would like to have
	their programs or scripts send email to interested parties
	in case something extraordinary occurs.  This document
	explains how to set up electronic notification email
	for a RedHat Enterprise Linux, Version 3, system,
	and provides some examples of how to use it.

    <title>A Few Examples</title>
    <para>
      Let us start with a simple example.
      <screen format="linespecific">
if ! mkdir dog; then
    echo "Could not make dog" | mail -s "Dog creation failed" alan
fi
      </screen>
      This script attempts to create a new directory named
      <filename moreinfo="none">dog</filename>.  If it fails, a mail
      message is sent to the user with name 
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="username">alan</systemitem>.
      Because the recipient address is just a username, the mail
      will not be sent out over the Internet. Instead, it will simply
      be sent the the user's mail file on the local machine. If user 
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="username">alan</systemitem>
      has one or more shell windows open, the shell will 
      notify him that he has received new mail the next time that
      he enters any command on the command-line. This is often
      all that is needed.
    </para>
    <para>
      The script could just as well have sent the notification to
      the user's Internet email address:
      <screen format="linespecific">
if ! mkdir dog; then
    echo "Could not make dog" | mail -s "Dog creation failed" afw@u.washington.edu
fi
      </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      If the examples above were run from the command line,
      the email notification would normally not be required. On the
      other hand, the scripts could be run automatically at some
      predetermined time by the <command moreinfo="none">cron</command>
      daemon.  
    </para>
    <para>
      In fact, it is sometimes useful to utilize
      <command moreinfo="none">cron</command> simply to send reminder
      messages. For example, the following line inserted into a
      <filename moreinfo="none">crontab</filename> table would 
      generate a reminder to change the backup tape in the
      tape drive every Friday at 3:00 PM:
      <screen format="linespecific">
0 15 * * 5   echo "Change the backup tape now!" | mail -s "Change tape" alan
      </screen>
    </para>
  </sect1>

    <title>System Administration</title>
    <para>
      The configuration of the <command moreinfo="none">sendmail</command>
      mail transfer agent is enormously complex.  Fortunately this
      process has been made much simpler by the use of configuration
      macros.  We will make one small change to the arguments to
      one of these macros.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Sendmail Configuration Changes</title>
      <para>
	We need to install the files that will let us change the
	<command moreinfo="none">sendmail</command> configuration.

      <title>TCP Wrappers Configuration</title>
      <para>
	TCP Wrappers is one of several layers of security which 
	protect a Linux computer from malevolent attack via the
	Internet.  In order to use
	<command moreinfo="none">sendmail</command> for sending
	notifications, we have to open up security so that
	at least our own workstation can receive messages from itself.
      </para>
      <para>
	On the Internet, the computer that we are logged into has
	several aliases:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      An alias host name:
	<systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">localhost</systemitem>
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      An alias IP address:
	<systemitem moreinfo="none" class="ipaddress">127.0.0.1</systemitem>.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
	We will now add the alias IP address to the list of
	hosts that are allowed to communicate with our machine.
	First we make a copy of the file that we are about to change,
	by putting it under the control of RCS:
	<screen format="linespecific">
cd /etc
ci -l hosts.allow
	</screen>
      </para>
      <para>
	Using our favorite text editor, we add the following line to the file 
	<filename moreinfo="none">/etc/hosts.allow</filename>
	<screen format="linespecific">
ALL: 127.0.0.1
	</screen>
	then use the <command moreinfo="none">rcsdiff</command>
	command to verify the result.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Testing the Results</title>
      <para>
	You can test the results by sending yourself or anyone else an email
	message from the command line.  For example:
	<screen format="linespecific">
echo "a message" | mail -s "a subject line" afw@u.washington.edu
	</screen>
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

    <title>Notifications from Cron</title>
    <para>
      The <command moreinfo="none">cron</command> batch scheduling daemon
      does not run from your desktop and is not attached to any 
      terminal or shell window.  If you have
      <command moreinfo="none">cron</command>
      run a command which writes output to 
      <emphasis>standard output</emphasis> or
      <emphasis>standard error</emphasis>, there will be no place for
      the output to go unless you add redirection to the command.
      Without redirection, <command moreinfo="none">cron</command>
      will send the output to your email in-box.  If you allow this
      to happen, your in-box will get very large, very quickly.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you do not care to ever see the output of a command run from
      cron, simply redirect all of the output to the null file. The
      following example shows a way (no longer the best way) to set
      your computer's Internal clock from a time standard via the
      Internet.  In this case, you do not care to receive email
      each night telling you that your clock has been adjusted.  The
      command redirects standard output to 
      <filename moreinfo="none">/dev/null</filename> and then
      redirects file descriptor 2, which is standard error, onto
      file descriptor 1, which is standard input, so that both
      of these streams are taken care of. (If this seems a bit
      esoteric, you are right. Just remember the pattern.  It works.)
      <screen format="linespecific">
30 22 * * * rdate -s bigben.cac.washington.edu > /dev/null 2>&1
      </screen>     
    </para>
    <para>
      You usually do not want your <command moreinfo="none">cron</command>
      jobs to run in complete silence.  This example will send you
      mail telling of success or failure.
    </para>
    <para>
      Here is a script to use tar to backup the home directory of a user called
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="username">alan</systemitem> who wants
      to be notified of success or failure at his emails address
      <emphasis>afw@u.washington.edu</emphasis>:
      <screen format="linespecific"> 
if tar cf home.tgz /home/alan > /dev/null > 2>&1 ; then
    echo "Tar was successful" -s | mail -s "Tar succeeded" afw@u.washington.edu
else
    echo "Tar had problems"   -s | mail -s "Tar failed"    afw@u.washington.edu
fi
      </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      The following addition to <filename moreinfo="none">crontab</filename>
      will cause <command moreinfo="none">cron</command> to run the
      backup script,
      <filename moreinfo="none">/home/alan/bin/shell/backup</filename>,
      once a week at 3:15 AM on Sunday:
      <screen format="linespecific">
15 3 * * 7 /home/alan/bin/shell/backup
      </screen>
    </para>
