<P>On terminals that support
Latin-1 characters, the character shown after <SAMP>`Char:'</SAMP> is displayed
as the actual glyph of A with grave accent.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="emacs_19.html#DOCF2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>Some systems use <KBD>Mouse-3</KBD> for a mode-specific
menu.  We took a survey of users, and found they preferred to keep
<KBD>Mouse-3</KBD> for selecting and killing regions.  Hence the decision to
use <KBD>C-Mouse-3</KBD> for this menu.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="emacs_19.html#DOCF3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>Placing it at the left is usually more
useful with overlapping frames with text starting at the left margin.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="emacs_20.html#DOCF4">(4)</A></H3>
<P>If
you run Emacs on X, you need to inform the X server about the location
of the newly installed fonts with the following commands:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre> xset fp+ /usr/local/share/emacs/fonts
 xset fp rehash
</pre></td></tr></table>
<H3><A NAME="FOOT5" HREF="emacs_20.html#DOCF5">(5)</A></H3>
<P>If more than one of these is
set, the first one that is nonempty specifies your locale for this
purpose.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT6" HREF="emacs_20.html#DOCF6">(6)</A></H3>
<P>It is also specified for MIME <SAMP>`text/*'</SAMP>
bodies and in other network transport contexts.  It is different
from the SGML reference syntax record-start/record-end format which
Emacs doesn't support directly.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT7" HREF="emacs_20.html#DOCF7">(7)</A></H3>
<P>The Emacs installation instructions have information on
additional font support.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT8" HREF="emacs_23.html#DOCF8">(8)</A></H3>
<P>SliTeX is obsoleted by the <SAMP>`slides'</SAMP>
document class in recent LaTeX versions.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT9" HREF="emacs_24.html#DOCF9">(9)</A></H3>
<P>The word "sexp" is used to refer to an
expression in Lisp.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT10" HREF="emacs_24.html#DOCF10">(10)</A></H3>
<P>On some systems, the <CODE>man</CODE> program
accepts a <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> command-line option which tells it to display all
the man pages for the specified topic.  If you want this behavior, you
can add this option to the value of the variable <CODE>Man-switches</CODE>.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT11" HREF="emacs_24.html#DOCF11">(11)</A></H3>
<P>The name of the command, <CODE>woman</CODE>, is an acronym
for "w/o (without) man," since it doesn't use the <CODE>man</CODE>
program.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT12" HREF="emacs_25.html#DOCF12">(12)</A></H3>
<P>Under a window system the arrow is
displayed in the marginal area of the Emacs window.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT13" HREF="emacs_29.html#DOCF13">(13)</A></H3>
<P>The US National Security Agency.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT14" HREF="emacs_32.html#DOCF14">(14)</A></H3>
<P>You should not suspend the shell process.
Suspending a subjob of the shell is a completely different matter--that
is normal practice, but you must use the shell to continue the subjob;
this command won't do it.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT15" HREF="emacs_32.html#DOCF15">(15)</A></H3>
<P>This
dissociword actually appeared during the Vietnam War, when it was very
appropriate.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT16" HREF="emacs_33.html#DOCF16">(16)</A></H3>
<P>Note that you
should avoid the string syntax for binding 8-bit characters, since
they will be interpreted as meta keys.  See section `Strings of Events' in <CITE>The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</CITE>.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT17" HREF="emacs_34.html#DOCF17">(17)</A></H3>
<P>
Here and below, whenever we say "colon-separated list of directories",
it pertains to Unix and GNU/Linux systems.  On MS-DOS and MS-Windows,
the directories are separated by semi-colons instead, since DOS/Windows
file names might include a colon after a drive letter.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT18" HREF="emacs_37.html#DOCF18">(18)</A></H3>
<P>
Note that the <SAMP>`net use'</SAMP> command requires the UNC share name to be
typed with the Windows-style backslashes, while the value of
<CODE>printer-name</CODE> can be set with either forward- or backslashes.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT19" HREF="emacs_37.html#DOCF19">(19)</A></H3>
<P>Normally, one particular codepage is burnt into the display
memory, while other codepages can be installed by modifying system
configuration files, such as <TT>`CONFIG.SYS'</TT>, and rebooting.  While
third-party software is known to exist that allows to change the
codepage without rebooting, we describe here how a stock MS-DOS system
behaves.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT20" HREF="emacs_37.html#DOCF20">(20)</A></H3>
<P>The standard Emacs coding
systems for ISO 8859 are not quite right for the purpose, because
typically the DOS codepage does not match the standard ISO character
codes.  For example, the letter <SAMP>`&ccedil;'</SAMP> (<SAMP>`c'</SAMP> with cedilla) has
code 231 in the standard Latin-1 character set, but the corresponding
DOS codepage 850 uses code 135 for this glyph.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT21" HREF="emacs_38.html#DOCF21">(21)</A></H3>
<P>The wording here was
careless.  The intention was that nobody would have to pay for
<EM>permission</EM> to use the GNU system.  But the words don't make this
clear, and people often interpret them as saying that copies of GNU
should always be distributed at little or no charge.  That was never the
intent; later on, the manifesto mentions the possibility of companies
providing the service of distribution for a profit.  Subsequently I have
learned to distinguish carefully between "free" in the sense of
freedom and "free" in the sense of price.  Free software is software
that users have the freedom to distribute and change.  Some users may
obtain copies at no charge, while others pay to obtain copies--and if
the funds help support improving the software, so much the better.  The
important thing is that everyone who has a copy has the freedom to
cooperate with others in using it.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT22" HREF="emacs_38.html#DOCF22">(22)</A></H3>
<P>This is another place I failed to
distinguish carefully between the two different meanings of "free."
The statement as it stands is not false--you can get copies of GNU
software at no charge, from your friends or over the net.  But it does
suggest the wrong idea.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT23" HREF="emacs_38.html#DOCF23">(23)</A></H3>
<P>Several such companies now exist.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT24" HREF="emacs_38.html#DOCF24">(24)</A></H3>
<P>The Free Software
Foundation raises most of its funds from a distribution service,
although it is a charity rather than a company.  If <EM>no one</EM>
chooses to obtain copies by ordering from the FSF, it will be unable
to do its work.  But this does not mean that proprietary restrictions
are justified to force every user to pay.  If a small fraction of all
the users order copies from the FSF, that is sufficient to keep the FSF
afloat.  So we ask users to choose to support us in this way.  Have you
done your part?
<H3><A NAME="FOOT25" HREF="emacs_38.html#DOCF25">(25)</A></H3>
<P>A group of
computer companies recently pooled funds to support maintenance of the
GNU C Compiler.
