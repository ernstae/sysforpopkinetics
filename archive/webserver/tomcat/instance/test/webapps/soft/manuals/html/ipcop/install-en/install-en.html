            IPCop Linux is a complete Linux Distribution.
            Its sole
            purpose in life is to protect the network that it is installed
            on.
            By implementing existing technology, outstanding new technology
            and secure programming practices, IPCop is the Linux
            Distribution for those wanting to keep their computers/networks
            safe and sound.
        </p><p>
            IPCop is open source and is distributed under the

            In addition to the many obvious advantages of open source, the
            fact that the source is open allows security experts, worldwide,
            to audit and fix security holes.
        </p><p>
            It will run on older &#8220;rescued&#8221; PCs retrieved

                You will be installing an operating system on the IPCop PC.
                It is a Linux based operating system, but it is not meant
                to be a general-purpose system.
                The firewall design attempts to eliminate as many features
                from the system as possible. The central idea is that the
                more code that runs on the firewall, the more places there
                are that are vulnerable to attacks.
                Do not expect facilities like sendmail or FTP daemons to be
                present.
                These are not needed on a firewall and may contain holes
                that are known to malicious users.
            </p><p>
                Although these instructions will appear to be long and
                often detailed, take heart.
                Once you've figured out what you want to do and have
                obtained your current configuration parameters, installing
                IPCop will take as little as fifteen minutes.
            </p><p>
                You will have to boot from the installation media or a
                floppy.
                The installation media is distributed as an ISO file.
                If you have a CD burner, you will probably want to create
                a bootable CD from the ISO file.
                If you cannot burn a CD, you will have to place files from
                the ISO image on a web or FTP server.
                If the IPCop PC cannot boot from CD, you will have to
                create a bootable floppy.

                Starting with IPCop 1.3.0, you can upgrade your IPCop PC
                from IPCop 1.2.0 or later and save your configuration.
                Use the web interface to log in to your IPCop PC and
                take a backup on a floppy, using the Backup Administrative
                web page.
                If you don't know how to do this, please read the IPCop
                Administration Manual section entitled

                During installation you will be asked whether you wish
                to restore your settings from a backup floppy.
                Insert the backup floppy in your floppy disk drive and
                respond, &#8220;Restore&#8221;.

                    IPCop defines up to three network interfaces, RED,
                    GREEN and ORANGE.
                </p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="green-interface"></a>1.2.1.1. GREEN Network Interface</h4></div></div><p>
                        This interface only connects to the computer(s)
                        that IPCop is protecting.
                        It is presumed to be local.
                        Traffic to it is routed though an Ethernet NIC on
                        the IPCop computer firewall.

                        This optional network allows you to place
                        publicly accessible servers on a separate network.
                        Computers on this network cannot get to the GREEN
                        network, except through tightly controlled
                        &#8220;DMZ pinholes&#8221;.
                        Traffic to this network is routed through an
                        Ethernet NIC.
                        The ORANGE NIC must be different from the GREEN NIC.

                        This network is the Internet or other untrusted
                        network.
                        IPCop's primary purpose is to protect the
                        GREEN and ORANGE networks and their computers from
                        traffic originating on the RED network.
                        Your current connection method and hardware are
                        used to connect to this network.

                    There are two combinations allowed in IPCop.
                    GREEN, RED is the typical network combination
                    specified for home and small offices.
                    GREEN, ORANGE, RED, is only specified when you wish to
                    run publicly accessible servers.
                    You should decide which combination you want for your
                    site.

                    If you are connected through an external modem or
                    router, you probably will be connected via an Ethernet
                    network interface card or NIC.
                    In any case, a similar card must be in your IPCop PC.
                    If you are connected via an internal analog modem,
                    ISDN modem, or ADSL USB modem, this must be moved to
                    the IPCop PC.

                    Decide what your GREEN or local network address range
                    will be.
                    This is not the IP address provided by your ISP.
                    Addresses on this interface will never appear on the
                    Internet.
                    IPCop uses a technique called Port Address Translation,
                    PAT, to hide your GREEN machines from outside eyes.
                    To make sure there are no IP address conflicts, it is
                    suggested that you choose one of the address ranges
                    defined in
                    <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1918.txt" target="_top">
                        RFC1918
                    </a>
                    as private (non-routable) addresses.
                    There are over 65,000 of these network address ranges
                    you can choose from.
                    For a list of available network address ranges, please
                    see
                    <a href="#home-nets" title="Appendix A. Quick Home Networking Overview">
                        Appendix A
                    </a>.
                    The easiest network to pick is the 192.168.1.xxx
                    network. This will allow IPCop to handle over 250
                    computers.
                    Typically routers and firewalls are placed at the top
                    or bottom of the address range, so we suggest that you
                    pick 192.168.1.1 for your GREEN network interface.
                    IPCop will automatically set your network mask based
                    on your IP address, but you can modify it, if you need to.
                </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="gather-hardware-information"></a>1.3. Gather information on Your Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
                Although IPCop will automatically probe your machine for
                NICs, it may be necessary to input individual NIC
                card's configuration parameters during installation.
                In this case the type, IO address and IRQ number will be
                needed.
                The easiest way to configure the cards or determine this
                information is via a program on the floppy disk that comes
                with the NIC.
                Alternatively, check the manufacturer's web site.
            </p><p>
                If you have an internal ISDN modem, IPCop will
                automatically probe it, too.
                Again, if IPCop can't determine the modem information,
                you will need to know the type, IO address and IRQ number
                of your modem.
                The easiest way to configure the modem or determine this
                information is via a program on the floppy disk that came
                with the card.
                Alternatively, check the manufacturer's web site.
                In addition, you will have to know the country and protocol
                of the connection, as well as the local phone number for
                your modem.

            </p><p>
                Insert any additional network cards needed to handle your
                configuration in the IPCop PC.
                You will need an Ethernet NIC for the GREEN interface.
                If you decide on an ORANGE interface, you will another NIC.
                If your RED interface is via Ethernet you will need one
                Ethernet NIC for this network, as well.
            </p><p>
                Insert the ISDN modem card, if needed.
            </p><p>
                During the installation process a video monitor will need
                to be attached to the IPCop PC.
                IPCop stays in character mode, so almost any monitor will do.
                The monitor can be removed after the install.
                In addition, a keyboard will be needed.
                If your BIOS keyboard test can be disabled, the keyboard
                can also be removed after the installation.
            </p><p>
                Set the BIOS parameters so that the target machine will
                operate, as much as possible, as a stand-alone server.
                For example:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                        Turn off the CPU power saver feature; the target

                        NICs and/or modems.
                        It's usually easier and safer to just turn
                        off the power saver features.
                        You can leave the video power saver turned on.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        Set the BIOS to boot on power up.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        Turn off the BIOS keyboard test, if possible.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        Set the power state to &#8220;Always restore power
                        after power failure&#8221;.
                        This will guarantee your IPCop PC will power up and
                        reboot after power is restored.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        IPCop can backup your configuration to a floppy
                        disk drive.
                        It is not uncommon for the floppy to be accidentally
                        left in the floppy drive.
                    </p><p>
                        If you are installing from CD drive, make sure
                        your system will only boot from the CD drive and
                        hard drive.
                        If you are installing from floppy, turn off

                There are three possible ways to install IPCop.
                The following table summarizes the requirements for each.

                If the IPCop PC has a CD drive and its BIOS can boot from
                CD, you can use the &#8220;Bootable CD&#8221; media for the
                install.
                The CD drive can be removed after the install.
            </p><p>
                If the IPCop PC cannot boot from CD, but has both a
                floppy drive and a CD drive, the &#8220;Bootable Floppy
                With CD&#8221; can be used.
                Both the floppy drive and CD drive can be removed after
                the install.
                However, if you plan on using IPCop's backup and restore
                facilities, you will need to keep the floppy disk in the
                IPCop PC.
            </p><p>
                Finally, if the IPCop PC has only a floppy drive or you do
                not own a CD burner, the &#8220;Bootable Floppy with
                FTP/Web Server&#8221; must be used.
                Again, the floppy drive can be removed after the install.
                If you plan on using IPCop's backup and restore
                facilities, you will need to keep the floppy disk in the

                    If you have a CD burner, use your favorite CD writer
                    package to transfer the ISO image to a CD-ROM.
                    Be aware that the IPCop CD image is a full CD image.
                    In many CD writer software packages, it can be
                    difficult to find the &#8220;Burn CD From ISO or Disk
                    Image&#8221; option.
                    The option may not be placed under the obvious menu.
                    If you wind up with only one file on the CD, you have
                    not created the CD correctly.

                    If you don't have a CD writer, have no fear.
                    You can still install IPCop, but you will have to go
                    through some extra work.
                    What has to be done depends upon the hardware and
                    operating systems you have available on other computers.

                        There are several utilities such as ISOBuster and
                        WinImage available on the Internet that can be
                        used to open the iso image.
                        Download one of them, and follow their directions
                        to open the IPCop iso file.

                        On Macintosh OS X, Apple's Disk Copy utility
                        will open the iso image.
                        There does not seem to be a free or public domain
                        utility available to open IPCop's iso images
                        on Mac systems before OS X.
                        However, many commercial CD-ROM burning programs
                        do have this capability.
                        If you have a CD burner, check the software that
                        came with it.

                    If your IPCop PC has a CD-ROM, but your BIOS will
                    not allow a CD-ROM boot, you will need to create a
                    floppy boot disk.
                    If your IPCop PC does not have a CD-ROM, you will
                    need to create both the floppy boot disk and the
                    driver floppy disk.
                    Both images reside in the
                    <tt>/images</tt>

                    This step is only needed if you are installing from
                    bootable floppy and FTP/Web Server.
                    In the root directory
                    <tt>
                        /
                    </tt>
                    of the iso image there is a file named
                    <tt>
                        ipcop.tgz</tt>.
                    This file contains a compressed image of the IPCop
                    hard drive.
                    Copy this file to a machine that is running a web
                    server or FTP server.
                    Put it where the server can find it during install.
                    During the install, IPCop will log in to your FTP or
                    web server as anonymous.
                    Most servers do not allow anonymous users to access
                    files out of the server's hierarchy.
                    Even though a directory appears at the top level of
                    the server, such as
                    <tt>
                        /pub
                    </tt>
                    they really are somewhere else, such as
                    <tt>
                        /anonftp/pub</tt>.
                </p><p>
                    If you are creating your private network for the first
                    time, change the IP address of the server machine to
                    be on the private, GREEN, network, using a static
                    address.
                    You only need to do this for the duration of the install.
                </p><p>
                    If your server machine is connected to the Internet,
                    remove the connection and physically connect your
                    IPCop PC and other machines together.
                    See
                    <a href="#home-nets" title="Appendix A. Quick Home Networking Overview">
                        Appendix A</a>,
                    for a discussion of your choices.
                    If you are using 192.168.1.1 for the IPCop PC,
                    192.168.1.2 is a good address for the server.
                    Set the server up with a static IP address, temporarily.
                    You will need to reboot any Windows PC if you change
                    its IP address.
                </p><p>
                    Verify that the IPCop installation file is available
                    via the FTP command or entering its URL from a browser,
                    even if you have to do it from the server machine.
                    You can cancel the download or close your browser once
                    you are sure the URL works.

                    Remember, installing IPCop on a computer will erase its

            Even though the IPCop installation steps are very similar, each

                Put the IPCop CD in the IPCop PC's CD-ROM drive.
                If necessary, put the IPCop bootable floppy in the floppy
                drive.
                Press the reset button to start the boot sequence.
                If the IPCop PC does not boot, check the BIOS boot parameters.
            </p><p>
                Soon the boot up screen, below, will appear.
                If it does not appear, check that your monitor is
                connected to the video port on the target machine, is
                powered on and that you have booted from the CD or floppy
                drive.
            </p><p>
                IPCop uses the LILO boot loader for all its boots.
                In case of errors, LILO will output nothing or only a
                portion of the characters &#8220;LILO&#8221;.

                drive.
                This facility is also intended to recover damaged IPCop
                installations.
                In fact, after setting up IPCop to your satisfaction, using
                the web interface, take a backup.
                If there is a failure, reinstall IPCop using the procedure
                you used to do the initial installation, and during the
                install, mount the backup floppy disk, and respond

                The sample, below, is for an NE 2000 driver.

                This facility is also intended to recover damaged IPCop

                In fact, after setting up IPCop to your satisfaction, using
                the web interface, take a backup.
                If there is a failure, reinstall IPCop using the procedure

            Some people leave the time zone as London or UTC.
            This allows you to leave your PC's hardware clock set to

            There are a couple of disadvantages to this setting:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                    You will not be able to use a network time server to

                    If your local time zone changes from Winter to Summer
                    or Daylight Savings to Standard time, you will have
                    to remember to manually change the IPCop PC's
                    clock.
                    If you set the time zone to your correct time zone,
                    IPCop will automatically change the time for you.

            Static addressing is used when your ISP has supplied you with
            a permanent IP address.
            Enter it in the IP address box of the dialog.
            IPCop will automatically choose a Network mask.
            You may modify the network mask as needed.
        </p><p>
            DHCP is used when your ISP has indicated you are to use
            automatic addressing.
        </p><p>
            Some ISP's, require you to provide a hostname to their
            DHCP server.
            This probably is not IPCop's hostname.
            If it's needed, you can probably use the first part of
            the fully qualified domain name you noted while gathering the
            <a href="#checking-dhcp-hostname" title="1.2.4.1. Checking Your DHCP Host Name">

            If your connection is via PPPOE, your ISP will supply all
            necessary information during the initial connection, so you
            won't have to do anything, after selecting it.
        </p><p>
            If your connection is via PPTP, you will have to supply your
            RED network IP address and Network mask, just like the static
            addressing case.
            This address is almost always 10.0.0.150 with a network mask
            of 255.255.255.0.

            Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol allows

        </p><p>
            You can delay setting up IPCop's DHCP server until after
            the installation completes.
            See the
            <a href="http://www.ipcop.org/1.3.0/en/admin/html/services.html#services_dhcp" target="_top">
                Administration Manual
            </a>
            for a description of the web based method of enabling and
            configuring the DHCP server.
        </p><p>
            You must select Enabled to enable the
            DHCP server.
        </p><p>
            The Start and End addresses define a range of addresses that
            IPCop's DHCP server will assign to computers when they
            ask for an address.
            Do not use your full network range for DHCP.
            At a minimum leave out IPCop's address.
            As a practical matter, at some future point in time you may
            wish to run servers that are only accessible from within your
            GREEN network.
            Whether they run FTP servers, web servers, sendmail or any
            other service that needs a permanent address.
            These servers should be assigned IP addresses outside the
            dynamic DHCP range.
            A good range might be from 192.168.1.200 to 192.168.1.250.
            This will allow 51 concurrently connected computers on your
            GREEN network.
        </p><p>
            DHCP will pass out one or two DNS server addresses in addition
            to IP addresses.
            If you wish to run IPCop's DNS proxy, the first should be
            IPCop's IP address.
            You can enter a second DNS address as well.
            If you do not want to use IPCop's DNS proxy and are using
            Static IP addresses, use the DNS servers you specified while
            setting up your RED interface.
        </p><p>
            DHCP works by passing out leases on dynamic addresses that
            expire after a certain amount of time.
            Default lease time specifies the default
            lease time in minutes that DHCP will offer.
            After the default lease time, the client computer will attempt
            to ask for a new lease time for its acquired address.
            When the maximum lease time has expired, the client computer
            is no longer allowed to ask for the acquired IP address, but
            the server may still pass out a lease on the acquired address.
        </p><p>
            Finally, the Domain name suffix allows you
            to specify a suffix that is automatically appended to DNS
            requests if the initial name can't be found.
            Many ISPs set up a domain name suffix, and then tell users to
            enter &#8220;mail&#8221;, &#8220;news&#8221;, or
            &#8220;www&#8221; to get to services.
            What really happens under the hood is that a DNS request is
            sent out for &#8220;mail&#8221; first.
            When the DNS servers indicate that they don't know an IP
            address for mail, the next request is sent out with the domain
            name suffix appended, i.e. &#8220;mail.xxx.yyy.zzz.com&#8221;
            To make life easier, you may wish to add this suffix in the
            Domain name suffix line.
        </p><p>
            Unfortunately, space does not permit enough room on this line
            for some domain name suffixes.
            Please check the
            <a href="http://www.ipcop.org/1.3.0/en/admin/html/services.html#services_dhcp" target="_top">
                Administration Manual
            </a> for another way to specify the suffix, which allows
            for a virtually unlimited length domain name suffix.
        </p><p>
            When you are done with the DHCP server configuration select
            the Ok button.

             If you are familiar with Linux you may wish to do

             &#8220;setup&#8221;.
             Enter the root password twice.
             Be careful, the root userid has the &#8220;keys to
             the kingdom&#8221;
             of your firewall.
             If someone gets its password they can cause all
             sorts of mischief.
             By default root is only allowed to log in via the

                Make sure you can access IPCop via a web browser.
                IPCop moves selected ports away from their standard numbers
                so that you can forward the well-known ports to real
                servers on your ORANGE network.
                The following examples assume you have set your GREEN
                network interface to 192.168.1.1.
                If not substitute the correct IP address.
                Verify that you can ping IPCop from a GREEN network
                machine.
                On Windows enter:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt>C:\</tt> <b><tt>ping 192.168.1.1</tt></b>

                On *nix and Macintosh OS X enter:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt>$</tt> <b><tt>ping -n 192.168.1.1</tt></b>
</pre><p>
                IPCop's DNS proxy has not yet been enabled from its
                administration pages, so the ping command, above,
                deliberately stops ping from attempting to look up the
                fully qualified host name of the IPCop PC.
            </p><p>
                If ping works attempt to access your IPCop by opening a
                web browser to URL:

                When you are satisfied with your IPCop installation, you
                can remove extra hardware on the IPCop PC: your video
                monitor and CD drive.
                You will probably want to leave your floppy disk drive in
                for backup purposes.
                If your BIOS permits, you can turn off keyboard detection
                and remove the keyboard, too.
            </p><p>
                If you remove the CD drive and/or floppy disk drive,
                remember to change your BIOS settings so the IPCop PC

                If you don't remove the floppy disk drive, so that you
                can use it for backup purposes, remember to change your

            enough to get you through your IPCop installation.

                Unless you wind up with very old Ethernet cards, your
                Network Interface Cards or NICs will probably support one
                or two speeds on the network, 10 megabit, 10BaseT, or 100
                megabit, 100BaseT.
                You can recognize these cards by the square connector on
                the back, called an RJ45 connector.
                If your cards have a different connector, check your
                manufacturer's web site.
            </p><p>
                Unless you have a very fast leased line connection to the

                    If there is only one computer on your network, all you
                    will need is a single category 5 crossover cable.
                    You can recognize a crossover cable by holding the
                    transparent RJ45 connectors at each end next to each
                    other.
                    If the wires in the connector attach to different pins
                    at either end of the cable, you have a cross over
                    cable.
                    Otherwise you have a straight through cable.
                </p><p>
                    Connect IPCop and your computer to each other with the
                    crossover cable.
                    You have just set up your simple network.

                    If you have more than the IPCop and a single
                    computer on the same network, you will need to add
                    another piece of hardware called a hub or a switch.
                    The Ethernet protocol sends message packets to all
                    computers on a network out of a single port, so all
                    other computers on that network have to be able to see
                    their packets, and be able to send packets to the
                    other computers on that network.
                </p><p>
                    If you have a hub or a switch, you will have to plug
                    each computer on a network into the hub or switch via
                    a straight through category 5 cables.
                    Make sure each cable is a straight through cable by
                    holding the transparent RJ45 connectors at each end of
                    the cable next to each other.
                    If the wires at each end attach to the same pins, you
                    have a straight through cable.

                    An IP address consists of four numbers, ranging from

                    This format is called a dotted IP address. Each
                    computer on your networks needs a different IP address.
                    IPCop, needs two or three different IP addresses.

                    The network mask determines the ranges.
                    Even though they are not mandatory any more, there are

                    One of IPCop's features is Port Address
                    Translation or PAT.
                    Using this technique any conversations over the
                    Internet will appear to originate from IPCop's
                    RED network address.
                    To help shield your GREEN and ORANGE networks
                    from malicious users, you should use private address
                    ranges for your network(s).
                    Remember, your GREEN and ORANGE networks must have
                    different network addresses.

                    You can, if you wish, subdivide each network using a

                    For example, if you wish to keep both your GREEN and
                    ORANGE networks in the same private range, and you
                    don't expect to ever need 32 thousand computers,
                    you can use 172.16.0.0 with a network mask of
                    255.255.128 as your GREEN network and 172.16.128.0
                    with the same network mask as your ORANGE network.
                    You will still have the ability to have over 32

                IPCop uses the Linux Loader, LILO, program for all its

                    If LILO fails at some point, the letters printed so

                                This shouldn't happen, but if it
                                does, it may indicated an attempt to

                During the install there are two hidden console screens
                that can be used for debugging.
                The screen you normally see during installation can be
                reached by pressing the <b>ALT-F1</b> key combination.

                After IPCop is installed on your hard drive, some late

            The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
            or other functional and useful document &#8220;free&#8221;
            in the sense of
            freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
            redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
            commercially or noncommercially.
            Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and
            publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
            considered responsible for modifications made by others.
        </p><p>
            This License is a kind of &#8220;copyleft&#8221;, which means
            that derivative works of the document must themselves be free
            in the same sense.
            It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
            copyleft license designed for free software.
        </p><p>
            We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
            for free software, because free software needs free
            documentation: a free program should come with manuals
            providing the same freedoms that the software does.
            But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be
            used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
            whether it is published as a printed book.
            We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose
            is instruction or reference.

            This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
            that contains a
            notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
            under the terms of this License.
            Such a notice grants a
            world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
            work under the conditions stated herein.
            The
            &#8220;Document&#8221;, below, refers to any such manual or work.
            Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as
            &#8220;you&#8221;.
            You accept the license if you
            copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
            under copyright law.
        </p><p>
            A &#8220;Modified Version&#8221; of the Document means any work
            containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim,
            or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
        </p><p>
            A &#8220;Secondary Section&#8221; is a named appendix or a
            front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with
            the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to
            the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and
            contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
            subject.
            (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
            a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
            The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
            the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
            philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
        </p><p>
            The &#8220;Invariant Sections&#8221; are certain Secondary
            Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant
            Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released
            under this License.
            If a
            section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
            allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
            Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
            Sections then there are none.
        </p><p>
            The &#8220;Cover Texts&#8221; are certain short passages of
            text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in
            the notice that says that the Document is released under this
            License.
            A Front-Cover Text may
            be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
        </p><p>
            A &#8220;Transparent&#8221; copy of the Document means a
            machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
            is available to the general public,
            that is suitable for revising the document
            straightforwardly with generic text editors
            or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
            drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
            suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation
            to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.
            A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
            markup, or absence of markup,
            has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
            by readers is not Transparent.
            An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
            of text.
            A copy that is not &#8220;Transparent&#8221; is called
            &#8220;Opaque&#8221;.
        </p><p>
            Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
            plain ASCII without markup,
            Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
            publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF
            designed for human modification.
            Examples of
            transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
            Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
            can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
            or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
            generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
            produced by
            some word processors for output purposes only.
        </p><p>
            The &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means, for a printed book, the
            title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
            hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in
            the title page.
            For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
            &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means the text near the most prominent
            appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning
            of the body of the text.
        </p><p>
            A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose
            title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
            text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
            specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
            &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.)  To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot;
            of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
            section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.
        </p><p>
            The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
            states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
            Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
            License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
            implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
            no effect on the meaning of this License.

            You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
            reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
            However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
            If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also
            follow the conditions in
            <a href="#quantity" title="C.4. 3. Copying In Quantity">section 3</a>.
        </p><p>
            You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
            above, and you may publicly display copies.
        </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="quantity"></a>C.4. 3. Copying In Quantity</h2></div></div><p>
            If you publish printed copies
            (or copies in media that commonly have
            printed covers)
            of the Document, numbering more
            than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover
            Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry,
            clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts
            on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.
            Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
            publisher of these copies.
            The front cover must present the full title with all words of
            the title equally prominent and visible.
            You may add other material on the covers in addition.
            Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
            preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
            conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
        </p><p>
            If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
            fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as
            fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest
            onto adjacent pages.
        </p><p>
            If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
            numbering more than 100, you must either include a
            machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,
            or state in or with each Opaque copy a
            computer-network location
            from which the general
            network-using public has access to download
            using public-standard network protocols
            a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
            If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
            prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
            quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain
            thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year
            after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
            through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
            public.
        </p><p>
            It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
            authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
            number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
            updated version of the Document.

            If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name

            with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
            Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
        </p></blockquote></div><p>
            If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
            combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
            situation.
