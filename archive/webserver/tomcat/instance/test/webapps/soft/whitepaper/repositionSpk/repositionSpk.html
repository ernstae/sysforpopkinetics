>The Current Distribution Strategy is Not Working</H1
><P
>&#13;      The initial beta-test version of SPK was not released to
      end users.  Instead, copies were provided to seven for-profit
      consulting and software firms working in the field of 
      biomedical research.  The rationale for limiting distribution
      to commercial firms was that, as a publicly funded research
      facility, RFPK ought not compete with the private 
      sector.  Instead, RFPK would form partnerships with the
      firms which otherwise might have been competitors and would
      reach the end users through them.
      These firms, which will be referred to as
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>partners</I
> in the rest of this paper,
      would add value to SPK,
      in terms of models, user interfaces and consulting.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      This distribution strategy has not worked well thus far.
      SPK has been in the hands of the partners for more
      than six months.  In that time, none of the firms has
      made the effort to run the software.  There are a number of 
      possible reasons for this:
      <P

>&#13;	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Level of effort to create a model.</I
>
	    Although several canned models were included in the 
	    release package, to seriously evaluate SPK in terms of
	    its own needs a partner would need to create one or more
	    models of its own.  This is not a simple process; it 
	    requires considerable effort and ability at programming in the 
	    C++ language.

>Uncertainty about the future of SPK</I
>
	    There are fewer than six months remaining on the National
	    Institutes of Health (NIH) grant that funds RFPK.  Even
	    if this grant is extended for an additional five years,
	    as RFPK has requested, the disposition of the
	    software after that time is not clear.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Uncertainty about licensing.</I
>  
	    The current license only allows the partner firms to
	    evaluate and test SPK for a fixed period of time.
	    Before investing any resources, most firms would like
	    to know what the eventual licensing terms will be.
	    In fact, given the uncertain future of RFPK, most firms
	    would like source code, at least in case SPK were
	    no longer being enhanced and maintained to their 
	    satisfaction.

	    partner who has provided feedback indicates that 
	    its clients would be interested in running the software
	    on Linux clusters.  Population models can take many
	    days to run on Windows workstations.  There is a 
	    clear need to provide a more powerful platform.
	  </P
></LI

    </P
><P
>&#13;      The net result of the decision to distribute the software 
      exclusively through partners is that SPK has no users 
      at all, outside of RFPK.  It will not have users until
      the partners invest resources in evaluating and adapting
      the product to their business needs, or until the distribution
      strategy is redefined.

>The Free Object Code Alternative</H1
><P
>&#13;      Free distribution of object code has been suggested as an
      alternative distribution strategy.  Free binaries could
      be offered to the partners alone, or to any organization
      requesting them.  In the case of the partners, being freed 
      from any obligation to pay a license fee might be seen
      as favorable to increased sales and profits.  In the 
      case of other researchers, this mode of distribution 
      would put SPK in their hands more quickly and 
      cheaply than if the software had to first pass through
      the hands of partners.  In any case, it would clear up
      some of the uncertainty about licensing.
     </P
><P
>&#13;      Although this strategy could provide some benefits, it 
      still would suffer from lack of any guarantee about
      the future enhancement and maintenance of SPK,
      because the development of the product would remain
      the exclusive domain of RFPK.

>&#13;      The best way to neutralize fears about the ability of
      RFPK to enhance and maintain SPK in the future would be
      to offer source code.  This way, a partner or an end
      user organization which felt the software was
      not being enhanced or maintained in response
      to its needs could undertake this work itself.
      If care were not taken, however, in specifying 
      the terms under which the source code
      would be licensed, additional problems would be created.

>Source Code Distribution Without Open Source License</H2
><P
>&#13;	Source code for software products has been distributed along
	with object code for many years.  For large expensive commercial
	software systems, this is the norm.  Customers require access
	to source as a guarantee that their investment will not be
	lost if, for whatever reason, the vendor can no longer maintain
	and enhance the software to agreed upon standards.  For their
	part, however, vendors are very reluctant to allow anyone
	other than themselves access to the source because they fear
	their intellectual property and their proprietary ideas
	will fall into the hands of competitors.
	The procedure that is often followed in the commercial
	software marketplace is for a copy of the source to be
	placed in <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>escrow</I
>
	with a third party, to be released only in case
	the vendor goes out of business or fails to support the
	product as agreed upon.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	A major disadvantage of licensing SPK with a source code
	escrow would be that it could provide an incentive 
	for a partner to take the software owner, namely the University of Washington,
	to court if the partner were dissatisfied with the 
	performance of RFPK.  This could easily occur, given
	that the aims of RFPK and those of most for-profit firms
	do not coincide.  If the unhappy partner won its case,
	it could wrest control of SPK from RFPK.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Providing source code directly, without escrow, to partners or end
	users would be even more disastrous.  Within a short
	period of time there could be several groups developing
	their own versions of SPK, all incompatible with
	each other and with the original.  SPK would give
	birth to several proprietary products, and RFPK's
	software efforts would thus be marginalized.

	amply demonstrated this.  A discussion of some of these
	projects and the many advantages of software development
	under open source will be summarized in the next section.
	For the time being, it should be sufficient
	to point out that the open source development model is

	      them could take over this responsibility.

      </P
><P
>&#13;	<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>&#13;	Would not SPK break up into a number of incompatible versions?
	</I
>
	No, because any
	group that enhanced SPK would have a strong incentive
	to submit the changes to RFPK for incorporation in a
	future release, in order to avoid having to maintain
	the software on its own.  RFPK would remain the focus
	of SPK development.  It would continue its own program
	of enhancement, but added to this would be the integration
	of enhancements by others.  
      </P
><P
>&#13;	<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>&#13;	  Why would partners have any incentive to make enhancements,
	  if they were required to give away their source code to
	  competitors or potential competitors?
	</I
>
	Because the open source license could be written to	
	insure that models and user interfaces were exempted
	from the requirement to distribute source code.  There
	is already a strong precedent for this.  The most famous
	open source license, the
	<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Gnu General Public License (GPL)</I
> which
	covers an enormous body of software including most of Linux,
	is one of the most strict open source licenses, in that it
	requires any derivative work to be distributed as open
	source. The <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Gnu Library License (LGPL)</I
>,
	on the other hand, allows works which are linked to the 
	Gnu function libraries to be distributed as proprietary
	binaries.  RFPK could pattern its license to be similar
	to the LGPL.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>&#13;	Would not RFPK and the University of Washington forego a lot of revenue by
	distributing SPK for free?
	</I
>
	Not necessarily.  Many
	of the largest commercial software enterprises in the
	world, including IBM, Oracle, Sun and Hewlett Packard
	are actively supporting, distributing and building
	products around open source software.  The key for 
	RFPK is to get users; then biomedical consulting
	and software development work will follow.  For instance,
	a partner may require a certain enhancement to SPK
	in order to satisfy the requirements of its clients, but
	the enhancement might be low on RFPK's priority list.
	The partner could develop the enhancement itself.  It 
	might make more sense, however, for the partner to 
	provide funds so that RFPK could hire additional developers
	to produce the enhancement, while continuing to proceed
	with its original list of priorities.  This sort of 
	thing happens all the time in the open source world.  
	Many millions of dollars of open source development resource are 
	being provide by commercial enterprises.

>&#13;		  Open source development teams differ radically
		  from their traditional counterparts.  Rather than
		  requiring all team members to work in close

		  managerial control, open source teams are often
		  constituted of members who live in different
		  cities and continents but
		  communicate via the Internet.
		  Development tools have evolved to support 
		  this new style of distributed collaboration.
		  In the University of Washington setting, these new assumptions would
		  coincide with the goals of flexible time and 
		  telecommuting.  In the RFPK context they would open the
		  door to cooperative development between the

		  To gain a bit of perspective on this, consider
		  SourceSafe, one of the 
		  Microsoft development tools currently in use by
		  the RFPK software team.  Four team members are
		  located in the same office, while one member is
		  in another building.  Although the two buildings
		  are connected via the University of Washington network, it is a 
		  common occurrence for the in-office developers
		  to be locked out of the development system while
		  their colleague is accessing it.  On a number
		  of occasions, this situation has persisted for
		  hours.  The problem would only be worse if
		  a need arose for one or more team members to 
		  work from home or from other locations.  The
		  basic flaw is that the Microsoft tools were
		  designed to support traditional centralized
		  development teams rather than distributed
		  collaborations.

		  deficiency.  These users would be self-selected

		  partners for support and consulting.  Others

	    If the decision were made to offer SPK as an open

		Beowulf cluster 
		to analyze seismic data for oil and gas exploration.
		Locus Discovery, a bio-pharmaceutical firm, uses
		a cluster of 620 nodes, each containing two 
		Intel PIII processors, to help design new drugs.

>&#13;		At present, RFPK owns a small Beowulf cluster, but has

>Transfer SPK source code to CVS</I

	  Every software development project needs a source control
	  system, to enable several programmers to work on the
	  same source files at the same time without wiping out
	  each other's work, and to keep a complete history of
	  all changes.  Currently, RFPK uses the Microsoft
	  SourceSafe source control system.  The inadequacy of
	  SourceSafe when used by developers in separate locations
	  was described,
	  <A
HREF="#ssfault"
>above</A
>.
	  The open source CVS source control system, on the 
	  other hand, serves geographically distributed development
	  teams very well.  Version 1.0 of SPK would be
	  entered into CVS which would control the source from
	  that point onward.  No attempt would be made to transfer
	  the history of the development of previous versions from
	  SourceSafe to CVS.  Instead, the history leading
	  up to Version 1.0 would be maintained as long as 
	  necessary under SourceSafe on the current Microsoft
	  server.

	  SPK is written in C++, which is a language which
	  originated in the Unix environment.  C++ applications
	  interface with the operating system via a library
	  of Unix system calls.  When C++ runs in a non-Unix
	  environment such as Microsoft Windows or NT, a 
	  library is provided which emulates Unix system
	  calls.  In effect, SPK is already designed
	  to run under Unix.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  As an open source rewrite of Unix, Linux
	  conforms to nearly all Unix standards and conventions,
	  SPK will compile and run under Linux with very
	  little change.  There are a few Microsoft-specific
	  areas in the code, such as file-locking interprocess
	  communication for the parallel implementation, and
	  the Matlab interface, but these are minor and
	  readily identifiable.

>&#13;	Population kinetic models can vary enormously in the
	amount of processor resource required to run them.  The low
	end of the scale presents no difficulty.  The problem
	can be run on a PC using convenient but inefficient
	languages such as Matlab, Octave, S and R.  The
	high end presents a major challenge but
	SPK is already positioned to
	make a major contribution.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	SPK can be thought of as an engine for running 
	a bio-kinetic models in order to calculate certain 
	unknown model parameters.  Models are software
	separate from SPK, although they must be designed
	according to certain specifications in order for
	SPK to exercise them.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	SPK is written in C++, a programming language
	which is capable of providing efficiency in numerical
	calculation that equals or surpasses Fortran, the
	language traditionally favored for this type of
	work.  As time goes by, improvements in the 
	efficiency of SPK will continue to be an important
	priority for RFPK.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Complex models with lots of data require lots of 
	processor resource.  For maximum efficiency, such
	models should be programmed in C++.
	Even so, a model may require weeks
	of continuous running on the fastest of PCs.  It 
	is obvious that such long running times are
	unacceptable to many researchers.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Just as with many other intellectual and creative 
	endeavors, the largest cost in kinetic modeling
	is the cost of human talent.  A close second is the
	opportunity cost incurred when research and
	pharmaceutical products are delayed.
	The cost of computer resources is at best of 
	tertiary importance.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	A highly scalable version of SPK would adapt
	automatically to the computer resources available,
	whether running on a Linux workstation or on
	Beowulf cluster.  On a cluster, the divisor by which
	the run time of a problem would be shortened
	would approach the number of nodes employed.
	A user organization that required faster 
	turn-around would simply purchase
	additional nodes for its cluster.  At present,
	nodes cost less than $1000 apiece.  The 
	cost effectiveness of this strategy
	will double at least every
	18 months for the next two decades, according to
	Moore's Law.

>&#13;      The goals listed in the abstract are all achievable, as well

      an open source project.  This move should be undertaken
      as soon as SPK version 1.0 is released, which would
      be the culmination of the long and intense development
      effort under the first NIH grant.  Version 2.0 should
      be open source, Beowulf capable, and domain-specific
