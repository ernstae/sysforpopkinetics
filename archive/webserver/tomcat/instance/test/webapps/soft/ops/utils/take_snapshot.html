<pre>
    take_snapshot.pl job_id ...</pre>
<pre>
    =head1 DESCRIPTION</pre>
<pre>
    Given a list of job_id numbers, this program extracts from the
    production database, spkdb, the corresponding rows of the job
    table, along with all related rows from the job, history, user,
    model and dataset tables, as if the selected jobs had been
    submitted but had not yet been compiled.  The output consists of
    three files suitable as input to the load_spktest.pl utility;
    namely the files schema.sql, basedata.sql, and userdata.sql.  In
    conjunction with the load_spktest.pl program, take_snapshot.pl can
    be used to populate the spktest database with a specific set of
    jobs prior to testing.</pre>
<pre>
    Here is a simple shell script that demonstrates the principle.  It
    extracts jobs 5, 11, and 15 from spkdb and uses them and related
    rows to reinitialize and load spktest:</pre>
<pre>
    #!/bin/bash
    take_snapshot.pl 5 11 15
    load_spktest.pl</pre>
<pre>
    The program is normally run on dbserver, although it can be run on
    any system that has an spktmp database and a properly defined
    database user, named extractor.  (See the discussion of this,
    below, in the section titled BUGS).</pre>

<pre>
    This program uses the following utility programs to do much of its work:
    
    dump_spkdb.pl
    load_spktest.pl
    mysqldump</pre>
<pre>
    It also uses the SPK Perl API module:</pre>
<pre>
    Spkdb.pm</pre>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h1>
<pre>
    The output files, schema.sql, basedata.sql, and userdata.sql, are
    created in the current directory.  If files with those same names
    already exist, they will be overwritten.</pre>
<pre>
    The utility makes use of a temporary database called spktmp, which
    is assumed to be located on the local system.  The utility can be
    run on any system which has a local spktmp database.  In
    particular, it can be run on dbserver, where such a database is
    known to exist.  To make it run on another machine, an spktmp
    database must be created, along with a user called
    &quot;extractor@localhost identified by 'extractor'&quot;, with table drop
    and create privileges.</pre>
<pre>
    Because the utility drops all tables in spktmp, then recreates
    them, only one copy of the program can run at a time.  A lock file
    is used to enforce this discipline.  If the lock file already
    exists, the program will refuse to run.  If no lock file can be
    found, the program will create one.  When the program terminates,
    whether successfully or with errors, it removes the lock file.
    If, however, the program is killed, the lock file will not be
    removed, and the utility will refuse to run until the lock file is
    removed manually.</pre>
