USER VISIBLE CHANGES

Additional residuals are computed and returned to the user:
FO Population residuals (PPRED, PRES, PWRES, PETARES, PWETARES)
Conditional Population residuals (CPRED, CRES, CWRES, CETARES, CWETARES)
Inidividualized residuals (IPRED, IRES, IWRES, IETARES, IWETARES)

The traditional placeholders such as PRED, RES, WRES, ETARES and WETARES
contain different values depending on the approximation method used:

For FO w/o POSTHOC
PRED = PPRED, RES=PRES, WRES=PWRES, ETARES=PETARES, WETARES=PWETARES

For FO w/ POSTHOC
PRED = IPRED, RES=IRES, WRES=IWRES, ETARES=IETARES, WETARES=IWETARES

For FOCE/LAPLACE
PRED = CPRED, RES=CRES, WRES=CWRES, ETARES=CETARES, WETARES=CWETARES


OTHER CHANGES
