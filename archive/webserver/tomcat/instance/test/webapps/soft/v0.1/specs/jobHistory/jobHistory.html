>&#13;      A job is created when the user combines a model with data and
      submits this package to be run by Spk.  Submitting jobs is one
      of the functions of the Model Design Agent (MDA), the graphical
      interface that runs on the user's workstation.  The job is 
      sent via the Internet to the Application Server (ASPK) to be
      translated into computer source code.  Once compiled, it is 
      sent onward, via the Internet to the Computational Server (CSPK)
      to be translated into machine code and executed.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The life cycle of a job can be represented as a sequence of
      states.  When a user inquires about the status of one of her
      outstanding jobs, the answer is based on its current state.
      The history
      of a job is the sequences of states it has assumed, along
      with the times of transition from one state to another and
      any outputs that have occurred.  The purpose of this document
      is to define the set of states that a job may pass through,
      and the rules governing transitions from one state to the
      next.
