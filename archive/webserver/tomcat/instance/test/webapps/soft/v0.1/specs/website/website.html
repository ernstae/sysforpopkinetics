>&#13;      The System for Population Kinetics (SPK) delivers its services to its
      users via the World Wide Web.  This method of delivery was chosen because
      it is available to scientific users everywhere.
      The user needs a workstation,
      an Internet connection and browser software. Any of the major operating
      systems will work, including Windows, MacIntosh, Linux and Unix.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The services provided to the SPK user fall into the following categories:

>&#13;	    All models and datasets of a user are stored in a database
	    in RCS archival format. This allows for the refinement
	    of models and datasets to create new versions, while 
	    retaining all previous versions.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    In addition to the archives of an individual user, certain
	    generally useful models and datasets are made available
	    to all users of an SPK installation.  At a yet higher 
	    level, certain models and datasets are available to all
	    users of all SPK installations that wish to participate in
	    this sharing arrangement.

>&#13;	    Comprehensive history of all past runs.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    The complete history of every job is retained in the database.
	    A user can access any previous job as the starting point for
	    a new job.  This history is also very valuable to the SPK
	    Software Team, so that they can analyze bugs, repair the 
	    software and then rerun any job that failed.

	  </P

	    bugs are recorded, characterized, prioritized, 
	    and resolved.  This software is accessible to the user
	    via the personal portal and via the MDA.
