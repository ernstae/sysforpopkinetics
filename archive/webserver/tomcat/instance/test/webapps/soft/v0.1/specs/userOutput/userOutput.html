>&#13;The data contained in the presentation_data element of XML Representation of SPK Results and Other Reports are transformed into table/matrix format with field headers.  The field header is the label of the data in the column.  The columns are separated by spaces.  After MDA has received and procesed the data, it permits the user to save the transformed data as a text file.  This data file may be used as input to other processing tools such as excel in Windows and gnuplot in Linux.

The paramters are in NONMEM's definition as THETA, OMEGA and SIGMA(population analysis only).  THETA is presented as a vector.  OMEGA and SIGMA are presented as matrices.  The order and the label of the data values in the vector or the matrices are the same as those in the comparable NONMEM report file.

To allow the user to select which scatterplot to present, MDA presents a dialog box on the user's screen with a list of available scatterplot descriptions.  The scatterplots can also be printed out in either portrait or landscape orientation by pressing the right mouse buton.

Before the file is saved, MDA presents a file-save dialog box to allow the user to change the file name, if desired, and to reconfirm the save file request.  These data files may be used as input files for other processing tools.  The data contained in these files are sorted data rather than the orginal computational server output data contained in the data file described in the first section.

The summary report includes the job discription, time of submission, time of completion, and SPK computing time, the model name, version and description, the data file name, version and description, the error message, the minimum value of objective function and a table listing the final parameter estimate, the statistics including standard error, coefficent of variation and 95% confidence interval, as well as the interindividual variability derived from the value of the diagonal elements of the OMEGA matrix and the residual variability derived from the value of the diagonal elements of the SIGMA matrix.

The minimum value of objective function is presented in the format in which it is returned from the computational server.  All data values in saved text files are expressed in scientific format with 5 significant digits, for instance: 1.2345E+01, -1.2345E+01, 1.2345E-01, -1.2345E-01.
