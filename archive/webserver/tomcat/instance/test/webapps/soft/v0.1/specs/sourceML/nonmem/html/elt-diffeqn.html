Required with ADVAN6, 8, 9. </p><p>

<p>
A differential equation must be specified for each compartment.  The DE for the first compartment is denoted as DADT(1), second as DADT(2), ... and n'th as DADT(n), where n is the number of compartments.
</p>
<p>
On the right hand side of assignment statements, the following variables can be used.  Pay attention to items with <font color='red'>Attention!</font>.  These specificatons are different from NONMEM:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>A(1), A(2), ..., A(n):
   Current compartment amounts (may be random variables)</li>

   <li>P(1), P(2), ..., P(n):
   Explicit basic PK parameters (may be random variables)</li>
  
   <li>PK-defined items that appear as left-hand quantities in <a href=elt-pk.html>pk</a>: Implicit basic PK parameters (may be random variables)</li>

   <li>T: Time; may be random variable.  T takes values continuously over an integration interval.</li>

   <li>DES-defined items that appeared earlier as left-hand quantities in <a href=elt-diffeqn.html>diffeqn</a></li>

   <li>Data item labels specified in <a href=elt-label.html>label</a> (<font color='red'>Attention!</font> This is different from NONMEM)</li>
 
</ul>
Variables that were predefined in NONMEM but have no special meaning in SPK are:
<ul>
   <li>COMACT, NETEXT, ETEXT, COM(n), COMACT, COMSAV, MIXNUM, MIXEST</li>
</ul>
NOTE: This element contains a set of equations written in the NONMEM abbriviated code, which is a subset of FORTRAN 77.  Cases are ignored; that is, "tIMe" and "TiMe" are treated as the same.
