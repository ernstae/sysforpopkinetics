>&#13;      In the future, it should be possible to migrate from one
      version of Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) to the next via
      an update process, in which most files in your system
      will remain intact. This is, unfortunately, not possible in the
      migration from Redhat Linux to RHEL.  Your entire disk 
      storage will be wiped clean.  It is, therefore, crucial that
      you prepare carefully for the move.

>Plan the Migration of Non-RPM Packages</H3
><P
>&#13;	The overwhelming majority of software packages on your workstation
	were installed by the Redhat Package Manager (RPM).  When
	you install RHEL, later versions of these packages will be
	installed automatically.  You may, however, have several 
	packages that were not installed by RPM.  These are most
	likely located in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/local</TT
>, although
	they may be elsewhere.  Only you know what these packages
	are.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	There are two basic ways to handle the migration of
	your non-RPM packages:
	<P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Reinstall them from scratch.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Similar to the way that you placed a copy of 
	      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc</TT
> on <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>whitechuck</SPAN
>
	      place a copy of the tar ball for each package
	      somewhere safe, so that you can copy it back 
	      and expand it after the migration.  Note, however,
	      that this might not work, because the package 
	      might depend in some way on RedHat 8.0 that is 
	      not compatible with RHEL.
	    </P
></LI
></OL
>
	Just to be on the safe side, it might be best to make a 
	copy of any non-RPM package that you are really depending
	on, even though your intention is to reinstall from scratch.
