	There is another type of mail which is important for anyone

	their programs or scripts send email to interested parties

><P
>&#13;      Let us start with a simple example.
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;if ! mkdir dog; then
    echo "Could not make dog" | mail -s "Dog creation failed" alan
fi
      </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      This script attempts to create a new directory named
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>dog</TT
>.  If it fails, a mail
      message is sent to the user with name 
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>alan</SPAN
>.
      Because the recipient address is just a username, the mail
      will not be sent out over the Internet. Instead, it will simply
      be sent the the user's mail file on the local machine. If user 
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>alan</SPAN
>
      has one or more shell windows open, the shell will 
      notify him that he has received new mail the next time that
      he enters any command on the command-line. This is often
      all that is needed.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The script could just as well have sent the notification to
      the user's Internet email address:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"

><PRE

fi
      </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If the examples above were run from the command line,
      the email notification would normally not be required. On the
      other hand, the scripts could be run automatically at some
      predetermined time by the <B
CLASS="command"
>cron</B
>
      daemon.  
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In fact, it is sometimes useful to utilize
      <B
CLASS="command"
>cron</B
> simply to send reminder
      messages. For example, the following line inserted into a
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>crontab</TT
> table would 
      generate a reminder to change the backup tape in the
      tape drive every Friday at 3:00 PM:

>Sendmail Configuration Change</H3
><P
>&#13;	The configuration of the <B
CLASS="command"
>sendmail</B
>
	mail transfer agent is enormously complex.  It has been made
	somewhat simpler by the use of configuration macros.  The principal
	<B
CLASS="command"
>sendmail</B
> configuration file
	is called <TT
CLASS="filename"
>sendmail.cf</TT
>.  The
	corresponding macro file is 
	<TT
CLASS="filename"
>sendmail.mc</TT
>. We will make one
	small change to <TT
CLASS="filename"
>sendmail.mc</TT
>
	and then use the <B
CLASS="command"
>m4</B
> macro
	processor to create a new
	<TT
CLASS="filename"
>sendmail.cf</TT
>.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Before changing <TT
CLASS="filename"
>sendmail.mc</TT
>,
	we should make a backup copy.  Rather than simply copying it
	to some file with a slightly different name, we will place
	it in a local RCS
	archive:

	Next we will use our favorite text editor to change one line
	in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>sendmail.mc</TT
>.
      </P

>Notifications from Cron</H2
><P
>&#13;      The <B
CLASS="command"
>cron</B
> batch scheduling daemon
      does not run from your desktop and is not attached to any 
      terminal or shell window.  If you have
      <B
CLASS="command"
>cron</B

      run a command which writes output to 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>standard output</I
> or
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>standard error</I
>, there will be no place for
      the output to go unless you add redirection to the command.
      Without redirection, <B
CLASS="command"
>cron</B
>
      will send the output to your email in-box.  If you allow this
      to happen, your in-box will get very large, very quickly.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If you do not care to ever see the output of a command run from
      cron, simply redirect all of the output to the null file. The
      following example shows a way (no longer the best way) to set
      your computer's Internal clock from a time standard via the
      Internet.  In this case, you do not care to receive email
      each night telling you that clock has been adjusted.  The
      command redirects standard output to 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev/null</TT
> and then
      redirects file descriptor 2, which is standard error, onto
      file descriptor 1, which is standard input, so that both
      of these streams are taken care of. (If this seems a bit
      esoteric, you are right. Just remember the pattern.  It works.)
