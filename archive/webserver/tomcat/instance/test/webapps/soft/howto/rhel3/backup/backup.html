></H3
><P
>&#13;	At present (May, 2005), a cycle of four tapes is used.  One tape 
	should always be in the tape drive.  Two tapes should always be 
	at an off-site location.  The fourth tape is usually brought to
	the lab sometime during the week, so that it can replace the
	tape in the drive the following Monday.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Use only DLT IV tapes.  There are some DLT III tapes in the 
	server area, but they do not have sufficient capacity.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	The tapes are numbered one through four.  They are used in the
	normal cyclic order.

></H3
><P
>&#13;	The only maintenance that we can perform on the tape drive is
	the occasional use of a cleaning tape.  We do not have a DLT IV
	cleaning tape.  Use the one that is marked DLT III.  Simply
	insert the cleaning tape in the drive.  The drive will sense it,
	use it for a few seconds to clean its heads, then eject it.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Use the cleaning tape about once a quarter, or if a lot of errors
	are reported during backup.

>Tape Backup Software</A
></H3
><P
>&#13;	We use a proprietary software package, called the
	<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>backup &#38; restore utility</I
> (bru) to back up 
	whitechuck to tape. We use the desktop version 17.0, because it is
	both inexpensive and adequate for our purposes.
	The more expensive versions can back up multiple
	computers over the network.  We accomplish the same thing by
	having file systems on webserver and cspkserver mounted on 
	whitechuck, using NFS.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Bru can be easily reinstalled from CDROM, if necessary.  The 
	installation wizard will ask for the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>license data</I
>
	and the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>license key</I
>.  These are printed on a
	label in the license brochure which should be kept in the box
	that contains the CDROM.  Be sure to install both bru and the
	graphical interface, called xbru.

>Scheduling the Backup</A
></H3
><P
>&#13;	After reinstallation, or if it becomes necessary to change
	the schedule, the graphical interface, xbru, can be used to
	schedule a full backup, either one time or recurring.
	At present (May, 2005), we choose to full backup once a week,
	on Saturday at 10 PM.
      </P

>&#13;	Select the option which overwrites any data already on the tape.

><P
>&#13;	Early in the week, preferably Monday morning, the backup administrator
	should remove the tape from the drive and replace it with the next in 
	the cycle.  To remove the tape, log into whitechuck from the 
	shared keyboard, video monitor and mouse in the server area, then
	input the following in a terminal window:
	<TABLE

><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;su -
mt -f /dev/nst0 eject
	</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      </P
><P
>&#13;	After the tape ejects, remove it from the drive and replace it
	with the next tape.  The drive will take a minute or two to
	read the header information and position the tape.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	During the time that the new tape is settling in, run xbru and
	use it to examine the execution log.  You should see three entries,
	each of which will include a count of errors and warnings.  There
	should be no errors and at most a few warnings.  If this is not
	the case, you will need to initiate a one-time full backup.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	In addition to checking for errors, verify that the total elapsed
	time for the backup is not becoming excessive.  At present
	(May 2005), the backup takes about six hours.  If this time
	becomes longer, it probably means that there is more data being
	backed up.  At some point, the amount of data may exceed the 
	capacity of the tape.  One reason for a rapidly growing amount
	of data is the inclusion in one of the developer home directories
	of a file hierarchy which does not really need to be backed up,
	because it is not changing. If that is the case, ask the developer
	to move that data out of his or her home directory.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	After the tapes have been switched and the backup log verified, 
	the tape that was removed should be taken off site.  It has
	been recent practice for the backup administrator to simply take
	the tape home at night, and to bring the tape that precedes it
	in the cycle to work in the morning.  For example, if the recent
	backup was on tape one, then tape four precedes it in the cycle,
	and is the one that should be taken back to work so that it is
	available on the following Monday.
