>Network Time Protocol</H2
><P
>&#13;      The Network Time Protocol (NTP) allows computers connected
      to the Internet to keep their clocks synchronized.  Certain
      host computers equipped with accurate clocks make the NTP
      service available to other, less well endowed, hosts.  
      A machine with an accurate clock which is offering an NTP
      service is known as a <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>level one</I
> NTP
      server.  Other machines, which may not be equipped with
      accurate clocks but which nevertheless have accurate time
      due to the fact that they are synchronized to one or more
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>level one</I
> NTP servers, can offer an
      NTP service over the Internet as <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>level two</I
>
      NTP servers, and so on.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The host
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>&#13;	bigben.cac.washington.edu
      </SPAN
>
      is a <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>level one</I
> NTP server equipped
      with a clock that gets its time from GPS satellites. 
      The RFPK Linux server,
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>whitechuck</SPAN
>,
      is synchronized to 
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>bigben</SPAN

      and several other <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>level one</I
> NTP servers.
      This document describes the way to configure your 
      RedHat Linux 8.0 workstation to synchronize to 
      <SPAN

    </P

>&#13;      There are two reasons for synchronizing our workstations to

      it is queried every 256 seconds, a measure of its estimated
      "reachability" is 377, there is a delay of 0.684 milli-seconds
      between the
      time it is queried and the time the response arrives, an offset of 
      0.075 milli-seconds was applied in order to synchronize
      the clocks and an 
      estimate of the random error is 0.024 milli-seconds.
