>&#13;      SPK is a complex system, comprising many software
      modules, a number of computers, and several technologies.
      When any software is modified, it must be tested
      thorougly before being put into production.  To minimize
      the risk that modifications would destablize the system, it
      is crucial that system-wide testing be performed on exactly the
      same software and hardware infrastructure as is used in production.
      It is for this reason that an SPK installation includes both 
      production and test environments.   Both are identical
      in terms of the following infrastructure components:

>&#13;      One of the key concepts in the 
      <A
HREF="../../../whitepaper/overArch/overArch.html"
TARGET="_top"
>architecture</A
>
      of SPK is that of the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>job</I
>.  With the help of the
      MDA, a user creates or imports a model and a dataset, combines them
      as a job, and then submits the job to be processed by the rest of the system. To test the system, it
      is necessary to have jobs which will exercise portions of the system which
      have been added or modified. 
      Test sets for system testing consist, therefore, of sets of
      jobs.  These jobs come from two sources:
      <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    The production database.  The utility program
	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>take_snapshot.pl</I
> can be used to copy a set of 
	    previously run jobs 
	    from <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>spkdb</I
>, creating files that can be used by
	    another utility, <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>load_spktest.pl</I
> to initialize
	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>spktest</I
> with that set of jobs along with related jobs
	    and data.  This is most useful for testing
	    modifications that either fix bugs or improve existing functions.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    The MDA.  Sometimes new features cannot be tested with existing jobs,
	    because those jobs would not have requested the features.  In this
	    case, the tester can use the MDA to create new jobs.
	  </P
></LI
></OL
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Sometimes a test set must be run many times, as the software is debugged.  
      Eventually, all jobs should run successfully.  At that point, the tester
      runs a utility called <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>stage_candidate.pl</I
>, which saves
      all the software in the test environment for subsequent deployment to the
      production environment.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      RFPK has a policy of deploying modifications to production on a scheduled
      basis, rather than doing it every time that some software has passed a 
      system test.  Instead, a number of deployment candidates will accumulate
      during the period between scheduled deployments, and it will be the 
      most recent candidate that finally moves into production.  This strategy
      has a number of advantages:
      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    Users learn to expect the behavior of the system to change on 
	    a scheduled basis, rather than randomly. This improves the
	    perception of stability.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    Communication of the changes can occur in an orderly fashion.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    Before deployment, a recursion test should be run, to insure that 
	    the modifications do not "break" something that worked previously.
	    Scheduled deployments reduce the frequency with which the recursion
	    test must be run.
	  </P
></LI
></UL
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Deployment is performed with the utility program <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>deploy_candidate.pl</I
>.
      It first makes a backup copy of the production system, so that it can be 
      restored if necessary. Then it copies the latest candidate into the
      <A

>production directories</A
