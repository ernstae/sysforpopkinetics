>&#13;      Unix
      depends heavily upon text files, both for data and
      for configuration.  This contrasts sharply with Windows and
      various legacy mainframe operating systems, which depend 
      on proprietary binary files, instead.  
      Whereas text editing
      in a Windows environment is usually accomplished using
      the rudimentary Wordpad or Notepad programs, the Unix
      environment offers much more powerful tools.  These tools
      make Unix a preferred environment for text work.  (This also
      applies to Linux, the free Unix-compatible operating system,
      and to Cygwin, a Unix-compatible environment which runs on 
      top of the Windows operating system.)  It should also be
      pointed out that the growing importance of text-based 
      markup languages, including SGML, XML and HTML, is elevating
      the importance of text files in all operating system 
      environments, including Windows.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The principal text editors are Vi and Emacs.  
      To underline the importance and the exceptional
      quality of these programs, it is worth noting that they
      were created by some of the worlds most illustrious 
      programmers.  Vi was the work of Bill Joy, the technical
      leader of Sun Microsystems, and one of its founders.  Emacs
      is the work of Richard Stallman, the founder of GNU and the
      open source movement, along with many others, including
      Jim Gosling, the creator of Java.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      How do you choose one or the other?  This depends on
      the nature of the work that you do.  The two editors
      fill somewhat different roles.  For many years now, Vi has
      been the default editor for Unix and Unix-like systems.
      Whenever you log in to one of these systems, you can be
      nearly certain that Vi will be there.  For this reason,
      at least some familiarity with Vi is a necessity for 
      someone who is doing any system administration or
      application configuration work.  Emacs, on the other
      hand, may be absent on a system that you need to 
      use.  Correcting that problem is the main topic of
      this tutorial.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Emacs came originally out of the MIT Artificial Intelligence
      Laboratory.  Though the core of the program
      is written in C, for machine efficiency,
      it is extended in Lisp, for human efficiency.  It is
      this extensibility that sets Emacs apart.  Important 
      extensions, known as modes, add features that understand the
      syntax of the particular file or files being edited.  For
      example, there is a C++ mode that understands the syntax
      of the C++ programming language.  There is an SGML/XML mode
      that understands not only the syntax of SGML or XML in
      general but, if the document starts with a reference to
      a Document Type Definition (DTD), it understands the syntax
      of that particular markup language.  For example, the
      SGML/XML mode enables Emacs to understand the syntax of
      Docbook or the syntax of Xhtml.  Because of the availability
      of many preprogrammed modes, Emacs should be preferred over
      Vi for editing documents which must adhere to complex
      syntax rules.

>Which Emacs?</H2
><P
>&#13;      Going back to the 1970s, there have been a number of
      versions of Emacs.  From about 1987 until the late
      1990s, however, GNU Emacs was without a doubt the
      Emacs of choice.  This editor was free, available
      on a wide variety of platforms, and was the product
      of Richard Stallman, the creator of the original
      version of Emacs.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Until the late 90s,
      the Emacs user interface was entirely driven by
      commands expressed as keystroke sequences starting
      with control codes.  This design was very efficient
      for experience users, but could be difficult to learn
      and difficult to remember for occasional users.  
      The GNU Emacs developers were on their way to creating
      a menu-driven, more user-friendly version of Emacs, 
      but were proceeding very deliberately.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      All too, deliberately, in the opinion of some.  A new,
      independent open source project, called XEmacs was
      born with the goal of producing an Emacs with the
      long overdue user-friendly features.  The XEmacs
      project put pressure on GNU Emacs,
      forcing it to catch up with the times.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Today we have a choice of two user-friendly versions of
      Emacs.  Although we owe the XEmacs developers a debt
      of gratitude for lighting a fire under the feet of
      their GNU Emacs counterparts, this tutorial recommends
      the use of GNU Emacs for the reasons of guaranteed 
      compatibility and respect for Richard Stallman and
      the GNU tradition.  The
      rest of this document will concentrate on a process for
      obtaining and installing the latest version of
      GNU Emacs.

	provides a list of elements allowed at that

>Install the .emacs File</H3
><P
>&#13;	When emacs starts, it reads a configuration file,
	if one is available.  This file can provide a 
	large amount of customization.  For instance,
	it can provide a list of colors to be used for
	syntax coloring; it can specify a default DTD;
	it can specify many options.  Because it can be very
	complex and usually contains lisp code, a detailed
	description is outside the scope of this 
	document.  Instead, the installation of a pre-made
	configuration file will be described.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	By default, the name of the Emacs configuration file is
	<TT
CLASS="filename"
>.emacs</TT
> and it is 
	located in your home directory.  Note that the file is 
	a <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>hidden file</I
>
	under Unix, Linux, or Cygwin, because its name starts
	with the dot character.  To see it in the output of the
	<B
CLASS="command"
>ls</B
> command, use the
	<TT
CLASS="option"
>-a</TT
> option.  
      </P
><P
>&#13;	How does Emacs know where to find your home directory?  If 
	you start it from a Cygwin shell window, Emacs will inherit
	the <TT
CLASS="varname"
>HOME</TT

	the shell.  If you start Emacs from a desktop icon, 
	<TT
CLASS="varname"
>HOME</TT

      </P
><P
>&#13;	If you ever intend to run Emacs outside of Cygwin, 
	it would be a good idea
	to define <TT
CLASS="varname"
>HOME</TT

	variable.  You do this in the 
	<B

CLASS="guilabel"
><B
>User Variables</B
></TT
> section
	of the screen, define the variable 
	<TT
CLASS="varname"
>HOME</TT
>, and specify the full path
	of the directory in which
	your <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.emacs</TT
> file 
	resides (normally the full Windows path of your 
	Cygwin home directory) as its value.

	has developed for this purpose.  A suitable file resides on the

>Conclusion</H2
><P
>&#13;      Emacs is the most powerful and most configurable text 
      editor ever created.  We have only skimmed the surface
      when discussing a few of the features of this tool.
      The time and effort needed to acquire, install, and learn to
      use this unique resource will be an excellent investment
      for anyone with a need to edit structured text.
