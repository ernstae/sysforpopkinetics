/**
 * Generate C++ souce code for definition of @a evalPred() function.
 * 
 * Given a set of mathematical expressions,
 * it generates C++ source code for defining the @a evalPred()
 * function.  The expressions are, without modification, 
 * included in the body of the function.  This function
 * inserts additional code to enable the expressions to
 * be cross reference or assign values to the other
 * variables appeared else where in the expressions.
 * 
 * @note The generated C++ source code assumes @a IndData.h
 * which declares @a IndData class and @a IndDataSet class
 * exist in the same directory in which the souce code exists
 * when it is compiled; in other words, it will have a
 * @code #include "IndData.h" @endcode statement.
 * 
 * @return void
 * 
 * @param out A file hander to a writable open file to which the generated
 * C++ source code is emitted to.
 * @em Invariant: @a out is open during a session.
 *
 * @param expressions A file hander to a readable open file 
 * from which the definition equivalent of $PRED (NONMMEM) is extracted.
 * The text has to be in all lower-case letters and written
 * in the C++ language. 
 * The set of expressions must at least contain two
 * assignment statements; one for assigning a value to @a Y
 * and the other for @a F, where @a Y and @a F can be refered to
 * as @a y and @a f, respectively.  The expressions may refer to the
 * @a THETA, @a ETA and @a EPS vectors freely by the names
 * @a theta, @a eta and @a eps, respectively and also
 * the symbols found in @a table or @a label_alias table.
 * @em Invariant: @a expressions is open during a session.
 * 
 * @param symbol_table A symbol table which contains all possible
 * symbols (variable names) that can be used in the expressions.
 * This would contain at last @a theta, @a eta and @a eps
 * as vectors of double-precision numbers and @a f and @a y
 * as scalars of double-precision numbers.  This is also a
 * superset of the set of names defined in @a data_label_alias
 * table.
 *
 * @param data_label_alias A map defining the relationship between
 * the label and its synonym assigned to an observation.
 * @a data_label_alias must contain at least two identifiers as key entries:
 * one for @a evid and another for @a mdv, equivalent of 
 * EVID and MDV in the NONMEM terminology.  These data items
 * will be refered to to determine the function's return value.
 * All identifiers must be also members of @a table.
