=head1 NAME

spkcmpd.pl -- the SPK Compiler Daemon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

spkcmpd.pl database dbhost dbuser dbpasswd shost sport

=head1 ABSTRACT

The SPK Compiler Daemon runs continuously on the ASPK server. It
selects jobs from the compiler queue, forks the spkcompiler to
process them, and inserts them into the run qeueue,  In cases where
a job fails to compile, the daemon records the error report and
the 'end' status in the database.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The program expects the following arguments:

    $database
        The name of the SPK database
    $dbhost
        The host on which the SPK database resides
    $dbuser
        A database username which has read/write access to the 
        job table
    $dbpasswd
        The password associated with the username
    $mode
        The test mode indicator being "test" for test mode
    $shost
        The host on which the job-queue server resides
    $sport
        The port number of the job-queue server uses 

The first thing that spkcmp.pl does after starting up is to call
Proc::Daemon::Init to make it into a daemon, by shedding its 
inheirited environment and becoming a direct child of the system
init process.

It then opens the system log so that it has a place to record progress
and error messages.

It attempts to create a lock-file if one does not already exist. The
method that is used assures that the process of query and creation
is atomic.  If the lock-file already exists, the program writes an
error message to the system log and terminates, because only one 
copy of spkcmpd.pl can be allowed run at any given time.

Next, it opens the database and connects to the job-queue server.

The program designates itself to be a process group leader. This
way it will be able to send signals to all of its descendents without
having to know their PIDs. 

The "stop" subroutine is designated to catch the TERM signal,
when it is received. As explained below, this will allow for
an orderly shutdown of the daemon and its sub-processes.  It closes 
the connection to the database and the connection to the job-queue 
server.

The last major step in the start-up sequence is to talk to the 
job-queue server to put any compiling jobs back to compiler queue 
that were interupted by the last termination of this daemon, and 
to put any aborting jobs back to aborting compiler queue that were 
interupted by the last termination of this daemon

At this point, the program enters an endless loop from which it will
escape only upon receipt of a signal. It queries the job-queue server
to discover whether or not a job has been added to the compiler
queue.  If so, a copy of spkcompiler is started as an independent
sub-process, working in its own directory on input provided by the
job. 

The program also queries the job-queue server to discover whether or not 
a job has been added to the aborting compiler queue.  If so, a 'TERM' 
signal is sent to the child process of the job to terminate the child 
process.  To avoid the "stop" subroutine, which is for the termination 
of the daemon, being called, the signal mask is temporarily set.

The daemon then checks to see if any child processes have 
terminated. If so, it moves them either to the run queue or to 
"end" status, depending on whether the compilation was successful
or not.  The daemon sleeps a second, before continuing the
loop.

The normal way in which spkcmp.pl is terminated is by using the
Unix "kill" command to send it the TERM signal.  When TERM is received,
execution is passed to the 'stop' subroutine, which had previously
been designated to catch this signal.

To avoid a loop, 'stop' sets the signal mask to ignore any
subsequent TERM signals. It then sends the TERM signal to every process
in its process group, which consists of the daemon itself and all of its
descendents. It waits for all sub-processes (which are 
instances of the spkcompiler) to terminate.  It closes the database
and the system log, then dies.

NOTE: Life-Cycle of the Working Directory Name

  1. A working directory must be created before each SPK compile is 
     forked so that the process will start up in its own unique space.
     There it will write its output.  To insure that the
     name of the working directory is unique, a suffix of the form
     "-job-jjjj" is appended to the name, where "jjjj" is the unique
     job_id that was assigned by the database management system when
     the job was created. 
  2. When the process is forked into a parent process and a child
     process, the Linux or Unix operating system assigns a process
     identifier (pid) number to the child.  Process identifiers are
     recycled, but only after a long time or when the system is 
     rebooted.  The parent finds the working directories of its
     children by maintaining a table relating pid to job_id.
  3. When a child process dies, the parent receives its pid as the 
     value returned from the waitpid system call.  Using this, it
     easily constructs the name of the working directory. After 
     extracting results and placing them in the database, the 
     working directory is normally removed, unless the constant 
     $retain_working_directory has been initialized to be true, or
     in case the run died due to an internal error. 

=head1 RETURNS

Nothing, because it has no parent (other than init) to which an exit
code might be returned.  The program does, however, write event messages
to the system log.

    # NOTE: Working Directory Name
    #
    # The name of the compiler working directory can change over
    # the life of the job:
    # 1. A working directory must be created before the compiler is
    #    forked as a child of this daemon, so that the compiler
    #    will start up in a directory unique to itself in which it
    #    will find its input files and into which it can write
    #    its output.  So that the name is unique, the unique job_id
    #    is suffixed to a prefix indicating that this is a compile.
    #    This daemon writes the job_id to a file within the working
    #    directory called "job_id", for later reference.
    # 2. After the fork, the pid of the child is known.  At that 
    #    point, the name of the directory is changed so that the
    #    suffix is the job_id.  This will be needed later when the
    #    child dies, because at that point the parent (this daemon)
    #    will be provided with the pid but will not know the job_id.
    #    After going to the working directory, the parent will
    #    discover the job_id by reading the contents of the "job_id"
    #    file, written in step 1.
    # 3. If a core dump was created when the child died, the 
    #    name of the working directory is changed so that, once
    #    again, the suffix is the job_id. This makes it easy for
    #    software engineers to find the dump in order to analyze
    #    it.  If there is no core dump, the working directory is
    #    removed when the child terminates.
