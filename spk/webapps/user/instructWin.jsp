            </p><p>
              2.  Scroll down to "Download J2SE" and choose your operating system from
                  the "JRE" column.

              3.  Accept the License Agreement (by scrolling down and clicking on
                  "Accept").

                  to end. Click "Finish" when the installation is complete.
