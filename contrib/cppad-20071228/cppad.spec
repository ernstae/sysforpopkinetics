# Preform the following steps:
# 1. Put a copy of the file ../cppad-20071228.cpl.tgz in 
#        /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
#    or get a copy of cppad-20071228-1.src.rpm and execute
#        sudo rpm --install cppad-20071228-1.src.rpm
# 2. Put a copy of this file (cppad.spec) in 
#        /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
# 3. In the /usr/src/redhat/SPECS directory, execute the following command:
#        sudo rpmbuild -ba --target=noarch cppad.spec
#
# RPMS Created:
# 1. /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS/cppad-20071228-1.src.rpm
# 2. /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/cppad-devel-20071228-1.noarch.rpm
# 3. /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/cppad-doc-20071228-1.noarch.rpm
#
# Note 1:
# There are no requirements because CppAD does not depend on any other packages.
#
# Note 2:
# There is no need for a debug or special architecture versions because CppAD 
# does not install any object or binary files. It is an include file library.
#
# Note 3:
# The is no base package cppad, only cppad-devel and cppad-doc.
#
# Note 4:
# The cppad-doc package has the following rpmlint error:
# W: file-not-utf8 /usr/share/doc/cppad-20071228/pmathmlcss.xsl
#    This is the standard presentation MathML style sheet. Except for white
#    space and a comment at the top, it is identical to
#         http://www.w3.org/Math/XSL/pmathmlcss.xsl
#    (use weget and diff -b to see that this is true).

%description
We refer to the step by step conversion from an algorithm that computes 
function values to an algorithm that computes derivative values as 
Algorithmic Differentiation (often referred to as Automatic Differentiation.) 
Given a C++ algorithm that computes function values, CppAD generates an 
algorithm that computes its derivative values. A brief introduction to 
Algorithmic Differentiation can be found at
Wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation
