RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 0.1.49
----------------------------------
USER VISIBLE CHANGES

At the end of a run, whether successful or not, the runtime daemon
copies the checkpoint file, checkpoint.xml, to the database.  This
will be used by the MDA to show the user the state of the computation
after the last iteration and to allow the user to create a
continuation job that would begin where its predecessor left off.
