USER VISIBLE CHANGES

Turned on the restart file machinery for individual level estimation
and for First Order (FO) population level estimation.

OTHER CHANGES

RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 0.1.42
----------------------------------
USER VISABLE CHANGES:
No more libspkcompiler built or installed.  spkcompiler (executable)
is directly built from source.

OTHER CHANGES:
Changed the structure in which Spk Compiler source is organized.
Consequently, all Makefile.am's are modified as well.

RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 0.1.46
----------------------------------
USER VISIBLE CHANGES

Sometimes either the compiler daemon or the runtime daemon or both
are not running at the time that a user submits a job. One reason
for this may be that when the system was rebooted, the daemon was
not given enough time to remove its lock-file.  A modification has
been made to  spkcmpd.pl and spkrund.pl to have the lock-file 
removed as soon as either of these daemons receives a termination
signal.

OTHER CHANGES: none

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

<RES, WRES>
New and seperated algorithms for computing weighted residuals
of predicted values vs. measurement data for individual and 
population data.

<ETARES, WETARES>
Additional computations for residuals and weighted residuals
of parameters for both levels of parameter estimates.

OTHER CHANGES
Integrated indResiduals() and popResiduals() and have them
compute PRED, RES, WRES, ETARES and WETARES.
