      <p><a class="indexterm" name="getstartSGML"></a> <a class=
      "indexterm" name="XMLgetstart"></a> This chapter is intended
      to provide a quick introduction to structured markup (SGML
      and XML). If you're already familiar with SGML or XML, you
      only need to skim this chapter.</p>

      <p>To work with DocBook, you need to understand a few basic
      concepts of structured editing in general, and DocBook, in
      particular. That's covered here. You also need some concrete
      experience with the way a DocBook document is structured.
      That's covered in the next chapter.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e592"></a> <a class=
        "indexterm" name="d0e598"></a> <a class="indexterm" name=
        "d0e604"></a> This chapter doesn't assume that you know
        what HTML is, but if you do, you have a starting point for
        understanding structured markup. HTML (Hypertext Markup
        Language) is a way of marking up text and graphics so that
        the most popular web browsers can interpret them. HTML
        consists of a set of markup tags with specific meanings.
        Moreover, HTML is a very basic type of SGML markup that is
        easy to learn and easy for computer applications to
        generate. But the simplicity of HTML is both its virtue and
        its weakness. Because of HTML's limitations, web users and
        programmers have had to extend and enhance it by a series
        of customizations and revisions that still fall short of
        accommodating current, to say nothing of future, needs.</p>

        <p>SGML, on the other hand, is an international standard
        that describes how markup languages are defined. SGML does
        not consist of particular tags or the rules for their
        usage. HTML is an example of a markup language defined in
        SGML.</p>

        <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e647"></a> XML promises an
        intelligent improvement over HTML, and compatibility with
        it is already being built into the most popular web
        browsers. XML is not a new markup language designed to
        compete with HTML, and it's not designed to create
        conversion headaches for people with tons of HTML
        documents. XML is intended to alleviate compatibility
        problems with browser software; it's a new, easier version
        of the standard rules that govern the markup itself, or, in
        other words, a new version of SGML. The rules of XML are
        designed to make it easier to write both applications that
        interpret its type of markup and applications that generate
        its markup. XML was developed by a team of SGML experts who
        understood and sought to correct the problems of learning
        and implementing SGML. XML is also <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>extensible</em></span> markup, which means
        that it is customizable. A browser or word processor that
        is XML-capable will be able to read any XML-based markup
        language that an individual user defines.</p>

        <p>In this book, we tend to describe things in terms of
        SGML, but where there are differences between SGML and XML
        (and there are only a few), we point them out. For our
        purposes, it doesn't really matter whether you use SGML or
        XML.</p>

        <p>During the coming months, we anticipate that XML-aware
        web browsers and other tools will become available.
        Nevertheless, it's not unreasonable to do your authoring in
        SGML and your online publishing in XML or HTML. By the same
        token, it's not unreasonable to do your authoring in
        XML.</p>

              Semantic Markup</h3>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e791"></a> <a class=
          "indexterm" name="d0e797"></a> <a class="indexterm" name=
          "d0e801"></a> An essential characteristic of structured
          markup is that it explicitly distinguishes (and
          accordingly &#8220;marks up&#8221; within a document) the
          structure and semantic content of a document. It does not
          mark up the way in which the document will appear to the
          reader, in print or otherwise.</p>

          <p>In the days before word processors it was common for a
          typed manuscript to be submitted to a publisher. The
          manuscript identified the logical structures of the
          documents (chapters, section titles, and so on), but said
          nothing about its appearance. Working independently of
          the author, a designer then developed a specification for
          the appearance of the document, and a typesetter marked
          up and applied the designer's format to the document.</p>

          <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e809"></a> <a class=
          "indexterm" name="d0e815"></a> Because presentation or
          appearance is usually based on structure and content,
          SGML markup logically precedes and generally determines
          the way a document will look to a reader. If you are
          familiar with strict, simple HTML markup, you know that a
          given document that is structurally the same can also
          look different on different computers. That's because the
          markup does not specify many aspects of a document's
          appearance, although it does specify many aspects of a
          document's structure.</p>

          <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e829"></a> <a class=
          "indexterm" name="d0e835"></a> Many writers type their
          text into a word processor, line-by-line and
          word-for-word, italicizing technical terms, underlining
          words for emphasis, or setting section headers in a font
          complementary to the body text, and finally, setting the
          headers off with a few carriage returns fore and aft. The
          format such a writer imposes on the words on the screen
          imparts structure to the document by changing its
          appearance in ways that a reader can more or less
          reliably decode. The reliability depends on how
          consistently and unambiguously the changes in type and
          layout are made. By contrast, an SGML/XML markup of a
          section header explicitly specifies that a specific piece
          of text is a section header. This assertion does not
          specify the presentation or appearance of the section
          header, but it makes the fact that the text is a section
          header completely unambiguous.</p>

          name="d0e875"></a> <a class="indexterm" name=
          "d0e881"></a> SGML and XML use named elements, delimited
          by angle brackets (&#8220;&lt;&#8221; and
          &#8220;&gt;&#8221;) to identify the markup in a document.
          In DocBook, a top-level section is <tt class=
          "sgmltag-starttag">&lt;sect1&gt;</tt>, so the title of a
          top-level section named <span class="emphasis"><em>My
          First-Level Header</em></span> would be identified like
          this:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;sect1&gt;&lt;title&gt;My First-Level Header&lt;/title&gt;
</pre>

          <p>Note the following features of this markup:</p>

          <div class="variablelist">
            <dl>
              <dt><span class="term">Clarity</span></dt>

              <dd>
                <p>A title begins with <tt class=
                "sgmltag-starttag">&lt; title&gt;</tt> and ends
                with <tt class=
                "sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/title&gt;</tt>. The <a href=
                "sect1.html"><tt class=
                "sgmltag-element">sect1</tt></a> also has an ending
                <tt class="sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/sect1&gt;</tt>, but
                we haven't shown the whole section so it's not
                visible.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt><span class="term">Hierarchy</span></dt>

              <dd>
                <p>&#8220;My First-Level Header&#8221; is the title
                of a top-level section because it occurs inside a
                title in a <a href="sect1.html"><tt class=
                "sgmltag-element">sect1</tt></a>. A <a href=
                "title.html"><tt class=
                "sgmltag-element">title</tt></a> element occurring
                somewhere else, say in a <a href="chapter.html"><tt
                class="sgmltag-element">Chapter</tt></a> element,
                would be the title of the chapter.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt><span class="term">Plain text</span></dt>

              <dd>
                <p>SGML documents can have varying character sets,
                but most are ASCII. XML documents use the Unicode
                character set. This makes SGML and XML documents
                highly portable across systems and tools.</p>
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </div>

          <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e959"></a> <a class=
          "indexterm" name="d0e965"></a> <a class="indexterm" name=
          "d0e971"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="d0e977"></a> In
          an SGML document, there is no obligatory difference
          between the size or face of the type in a first-level
          section header and the title of a book in a footnote or
          the first sentence of a body paragraph. All SGML files
          are simple text files without font changes or special
          characters.<sup>[<a name="d0e987" href=
          "#ftn.d0e987">1</a>]</sup> Similarly, an SGML document
          does not specify the words in a text that are to be set
          in italic, bold, or roman type. Instead, SGML marks
          certain kinds of texts for their semantic content. For
          example, if a particular word is the name of a file, then
          the tags around it should specify that it is a
          filename:</p>
<pre class="screen">
Many mail programs read configuration information from the
users <tt class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;filename&gt;</tt>.mailrc<tt
class="sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/filename&gt;</tt> file.
</pre>

          <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1013"></a> <a class=
          "indexterm" name="d0e1019"></a> <a class="indexterm"
          name="d0e1025"></a> <a class="indexterm" name=
          "d0e1029"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1033"></a>
          <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1039"></a> <a class=
          "indexterm" name="d0e1043"></a> If the meaning of a
          phrase is particularly audacious, it might get tagged for
          boldness of thought instead of appearance. An SGML
          document contains all the information that a typesetter
          needs to lay out and typeset a printed page in the most
          effective and consistent way, but it does not specify the
          layout or the type.<sup>[<a name="d0e1052" href=
          "#ftn.d0e1052">2</a>]</sup></p>

          <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1078"></a> <a class=
          "indexterm" name="d0e1084"></a> <a class="indexterm"
          name="d0e1090"></a> <a class="indexterm" name=
          "d0e1096"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1104"></a>
          <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1108"></a> <a class=
          "indexterm" name="d0e1112"></a> Not only is the structure
          of an SGML/XML document explicit, but it is also
          carefully controlled. An SGML document makes reference to
          a set of declarations&#8212;a document type definition
          (DTD)&#8212;that contains an inventory of tag names and
          specifies the combination rules for the various
          structural and semantic features that make up a document.
          What the distinctive features are and how they should be
          combined is &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; in the sense that
          almost any selection of features and rules of composition
          is theoretically possible. The DocBook DTD chooses a
          particular set of features and rules for its users.</p>

          <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1137"></a> Here is a
          specific example of how the DocBook DTD works. DocBook
          specifies that a third-level section can follow a
          second-level section but cannot follow a first-level
          section without an intervening second-level section.</p>

          "d0e1182"></a> Because an SGML/XML document has an
          associated DTD that describes the valid, logical
          structures of the document, you can test the logical
          structure of any particular document against the DTD.
          This process is performed by a <i>parser</i>. An SGML
          processor must begin by parsing the document and
          determining if it is valid, that is, if it conforms to
          the rules specified in the DTD. XML processors are not
          required to check for validity, but it's always a good
          idea to check for validity when authoring. Because you
          can test and validate the structure of an SGML/XML
          document with software, a DocBook document containing a
          first-level section followed immediately by a third-level
          section will be identified as invalid, meaning that it's
          not a valid <i>instance</i> or example of a document
          defined by the DocBook DTD. Presumably, a document with a
          logical structure won't normally jump from a first- to a
          third-level section, so the rule is a safeguard&#8212;but
          not a guarantee&#8212;of good writing, or at the very
          least, reasonable structure. A parser also verifies that
          the names of the tags are correct and that tags requiring
          an ending tag have them. This means that a valid document
          is also one that should format correctly, without runs of
          paragraphs incorrectly appearing in bold type or similar
          monstrosities that everyone has seen in print at one time
          or another. For more information about SGML/XML parsers,
          see <a href="ch03.html" title=
          "Parsing DocBook Documents">Chapter&#160;3</a>.</p>

          <p>In general, adherence to the explicit rules of
          structure and markup in a DTD is a useful and reassuring
          guarantee of consistency and reliability within
          documents, across document sets, and over time. This
          makes SGML/XML markup particularly desirable to
          corporations or governments that have large sets of
          documents to manage, but it is a boon to the individual
          writer as well.</p>

            markup makes your documents more amenable to
            interpretation by software, especially publishing
            software. You can publish a white paper, authored as a
            DocBook <a href="article.html"><tt class=

            <p>You can produce each of these publications from
            exactly the same source document using the
            presentational techniques best suited to both the
            content of the document and the presentation medium.
            This versatility also frees the author to concentrate
            on the document content. For example, as we write this
            book, we don't know exactly how O'Reilly will choose to
            present chapter headings, bulleted lists, SGML terms,
            or any of the other semantic features. And we don't
            care. It's irrelevant; whatever presentation is chosen,
            the SGML sources will be transformed automatically into
            that style.</p>

            <p>Semantic markup can relieve the author of other,
            more significant burdens as well (after all, careful
            use of paragraph and character styles in a word
            processor document theoretically allows us to change
            the presentation independently from the document).
            Using semantic markup opens up your documents to a
            world of possibilities. Documents become, in a loose
            sense, databases of information. Programs can compile,
            retrieve, and otherwise manipulate the documents in
            predictable, useful ways.</p>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1298"></a> <a class=
            "indexterm" name="d0e1304"></a> Consider the online
            version of this book: almost every element name (<a
            href="article.html"><tt class=
            "sgmltag-element">Article</tt></a>, <a href=
            "book.html"><tt class="sgmltag-element">Book</tt></a>,
            and so on) is a hyperlink to the reference page that
            describes that element. Maintaining these links by hand
            would be tedious and might be unreliable, as well.
            Instead, every element name is marked as an element
            using <a href="sgmltag.html"><tt class=
            "sgmltag-element">SGMLTag</tt></a>: a <a href=
            "book.html"><tt class="sgmltag-element">Book</tt></a>
            is a <tt><tt class=
            "sgmltag-starttag">&lt;sgmltag&gt;</tt>Book<tt class=
            "sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/sgmltag&gt;</tt></tt>.</p>

            <p>Because each element name in this book is tagged
            semantically, the program that produces the online
            version can determine which occurrences of the word
            &#8220;book&#8221; in the text are actually references
            to the <a href="book.html"><tt class=
            "sgmltag-element">Book</tt></a> element. The program
            can then automatically generate the appropriate
            hyperlink when it should.</p>

            <p>There's one last point to make about the versatility
            of SGML documents: how much you have depends on the
            DTD. If you take a good photo with a high resolution
            lens, you can print it and copy it and scan it and put
            it on the Web, and it will look good. If you start with
            a low-resolution picture it will not survive those
            transformations so well. DocBook SGML/XML has this
            advantage over, say, HTML: DocBook has specific and
            unambiguous semantic and structural markup, because you
            can convert its documents with ease into other
            presentational forms, and search them more precisely.
            If you start with HTML, whose markup is at a lower
            resolution than DocBook's, your versatility and
            searchability is substantially restricted and cannot be
            improved.</p>

              </div>
            </div>

            <p>There are a few significant shortcomings to

            <div class="itemizedlist">
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>
                  <p>It requires a significant change in the
                  authoring process. Writing structured documents
                  is very different from writing with a typical
                  word processor, and change is difficult. In
                  particular, authors don't like giving up control
                  over the appearance of their words especially now
                  that they have acquired it with the advent of
                  word processors. But many publishing companies
                  need authors to relinquish that control, because
                  book design and production remains their job, not
                  their authors'.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Because semantics are separate from
                  appearance, in order to publish an SGML/XML
                  document, a stylesheet or other tool must create
                  the presentational form from the structural form.
                  Writing stylesheets is a skill in its own right,
                  and though not every author among a group of
                  authors has to learn how to write them, someone
                  has to.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Authoring tools for SGML documents can
                  generally be pretty expensive. While it's not
                  entirely unreasonable to edit SGML/XML documents
                  with a simple text editor, it's a bit tedious to
                  do so. However, there are a few free tools that
                  are SGML-aware. The widespread interest in XML
                  may well produce new, clever, and less expensive
                  XML editing tools.</p>

        name="d0e1428"></a> <a class="indexterm" name=
        "d0e1432"></a> SGML/XML markup consists primarily of
        <i>elements</i>, <i>attributes</i>, and <i>entities</i>.
        Elements are the terms we have been speaking about most,
        like <a href="sect1.html"><tt class=
        "sgmltag-element">sect1</tt></a>, that describe a
        document's content and structure. Most elements are
        represented by pairs of tags and mark the start and end of
        the construct they surround&#8212;for example, the SGML
        source for this particular paragraph begins with a <tt
        class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;para&gt;</tt> tag and ends
        with a <tt class="sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/para&gt;</tt> tag.
        Some elements are &#8220;empty&#8221; (such as DocBook's
        cross-reference element, <tt class=
        "sgmltag-starttag">&lt;xref&gt;</tt>) and require no end
        tag.<sup>[<a name="d0e1468" href=
        "#ftn.d0e1468">3</a>]</sup></p>

        <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1482"></a> <a class=
        "indexterm" name="d0e1488"></a> <a class="indexterm" name=
        "d0e1494"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1500"></a>
        Elements can, but don't necessarily, include one or more
        attributes, which are additional terms that extend the
        function or refine the content of a given element. For
        instance, in DocBook a <tt class=
        "sgmltag-starttag">&lt;sect1&gt;</tt> start tag can contain
        an identifier&#8212;an <tt class=
        "sgmltag-attribute">id</tt> attribute&#8212;that will
        ultimately allow the writer to cross-reference it or enable
        a reader to retrieve it. End tags cannot contain
        attributes. A <tt class=
        "sgmltag-starttag">&lt;sect1&gt;</tt> element with an <tt
        class="sgmltag-attribute">id</tt> attribute looks like
        this:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;sect1 id="<i><tt>idvalue</tt></i>"&gt;
</pre>

        <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1525"></a> <a class=
        "indexterm" name="d0e1531"></a> <a class="indexterm" name=
        "d0e1537"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1543"></a> In
        SGML, the catalog of attributes that can occur on an
        element is predefined. You cannot add arbitrary attribute
        names to an element. Similarly, the values allowed for each
        attribute are predefined. In XML, the use of <a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/" target=
        "_top">namespaces</a> may allow you to add additional
        attributes to an element, but as of this writing, there's
        no way to perform validation on those attributes.</p>

        <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1560"></a> <a class=
        "indexterm" name="d0e1566"></a> The <tt class=
        "sgmltag-attribute">id</tt> attribute is one half of a
        cross reference. An <tt class=
        "sgmltag-attribute">idref</tt> attribute on another
        element, for example <tt class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;xref
        linkend=&#8221;idvalue&#8221; &gt;</tt>, provides the other
        half. These attributes provide whatever application might
        process the SGML source with the data needed either to make
        a hypertext link or to substitute a named and/or numbered
        cross reference in place of the <tt class=
        "sgmltag-starttag">&lt; xref&gt;</tt>. Another use for
        attributes is to specify subclasses of certain elements.
        For instance, you can subdivide DocBook's <tt class=
        "sgmltag-starttag">&lt;systemitem&gt;</tt> into URLs and
        email addresses by making the content of the <tt class=
        "sgmltag-attribute">role</tt> attribute the distinction
        between them, as in <tt class=
        "sgmltag-starttag">&lt;systemitem role="URL"&gt;</tt>
        versus <tt class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;systemitem
        role="emailaddr"&gt;</tt>.</p>

        Entities are a fundamental concept in SGML and XML, and can
        be somewhat daunting at first. They serve a number of
        related, but slightly different functions, and this makes
        them a little bit complicated.</p>

        <p>In the most general terms, entities allow you to assign
        a name to some chunk of data, and use that name to refer to
        that data. The complexity arises because there are two
        different contexts in which you can use entities (in the
        DTD and in your documents), two types of entities (parsed
        and unparsed), and two or three different ways in which the
        entities can point to the chunk of data that they name.</p>

        <p>In the rest of this section, we'll describe each of the
        commonly encountered entity types. If you find the material
        in this section confusing, feel free to skip over it now
        and come back to it later. We'll refer to the different
        types of entities as the need arises in our discussion of
        DocBook. Come back to this section when you're looking for
        more detail.</p>

        <p>Entities can be divided into two broad categories,
        <i>general entities</i> and <i>parameter entities</i>.
        Parameter entities are most often used in the DTD, not in
        documents, so we'll describe them last. Before you can use
        any type of entity, it must be formally declared. This is
        typically done in the document prologue, as we'll explain
        in <a href="ch02.html" title=
        "Creating DocBook Documents">Chapter&#160;2</a>, but we
        will show you how to declare each of the entities discussed
        here.</p>

          <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1658"></a> <a class=
          "indexterm" name="d0e1664"></a> In use, general entities
          are introduced with an ampersand (&amp;) and end with a
          semicolon (;). Within the category of general entities,
          there are two types: <i>internal general entities</i> and
          <i>external general entities</i>.</p>

            "indexterm" name="d0e1685"></a> <a class="indexterm"
            name="d0e1691"></a> With internal entities, you can
            associate an essentially arbitrary piece of text (which
            may have other markup, including references to other
            entities) with a name. You can then include that text
            by referring to its name. For example, if your document
            frequently refers to, say, &#8220;O'Reilly &amp;
            Associates,&#8221; you might declare it as an
            entity:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;!ENTITY ora "O'Reilly &amp;amp; Associates"&gt;
</pre>

            <p>Then, instead of typing it out each time, you can
            insert it as needed in your document with the entity
            reference <tt class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;ora;</tt>,
            simply to save time. Note that this entity declaration
            includes another entity reference within it. That's
            perfectly valid as long as the reference isn't directly
            or indirectly recursive.</p>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1706"></a> If you find
            that you use a number of entities across many
            documents, you can add them directly to the DTD and
            avoid having to include the declarations in each
            document. See the discussion of <tt>dbgenent.mod</tt>

                general entities</h4>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1725"></a> <a class=
            "indexterm" name="d0e1729"></a> <a class="indexterm"
            name="d0e1735"></a> <a class="indexterm" name=
            "d0e1741"></a> With external entities, you can
            reference other documents from within your document. If
            these entities contain document text (SGML or XML),
            then references to them cause the parser to insert the
            text of the external file directly into your document
            (these are called parsed entities). In this way, you
            can use entities to divide your single, logical
            document into physically distinct chunks. For example,
            you might break your document into four chapters and
            store them in separate files. At the top of your
            document, you would include entity declarations to
            reference the four files:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;!ENTITY ch01 SYSTEM "ch01.sgm"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY ch02 SYSTEM "ch02.sgm"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY ch03 SYSTEM "ch03.sgm"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY ch04 SYSTEM "ch04.sgm"&gt;
</pre>

            <p>Your <a href="book.html"><tt class=
            "sgmltag-element">Book</tt></a> now consists simply of
            references to the entities:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;book&gt;
&amp;ch01;
&amp;ch02;
&amp;ch03;
&amp;ch04;
&lt;/book&gt;
</pre>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1764"></a> <a class=
            "indexterm" name="d0e1768"></a> Sometimes it's useful
            to reference external files that don't contain document
            text. For example, you might want to reference an
            external graphic. You can do this with entities by
            declaring the type of data that's in the entity using a
            notation (these are called unparsed entities). For
            example, the following declaration declares the entity
            <tt>tree</tt> as an encapsulated PostScript image:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;!ENTITY tree SYSTEM "tree.eps" NDATA EPS&gt;
</pre>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1779"></a> Entities
            declared this way cannot be inserted directly into your
            document. Instead, they must be used as entity
            attributes to elements:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;graphic entityref="tree"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt;
</pre>

            <p>Conversely, you cannot use entities declared without
            a notation as the value of an entity attribute.</p>

                characters</h4>
              </div>

            name="d0e1806"></a> In order for the parser to
            recognize markup in your document, it must be able to
            distinguish markup from content. It does this with two
            special characters: &#8220;&lt;,&#8221; which
            identifies the beginning of a start or end tag, and
            &#8220;&amp;,&#8221; which identifies the beginning of
            an entity reference.<sup>[<a name="d0e1812" href=
            "#ftn.d0e1812">4</a>]</sup> If you want these
            characters to have their literal value, they must be
            encoded as entity references in your document. The
            entity reference <tt class=
            "sgmltag-genentity">&amp;lt;</tt> produces a left angle
            bracket; <tt class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;amp;</tt>
            produces the ampersand.<sup>[<a name="d0e1862" href=
            "#ftn.d0e1862">5</a>]</sup></p>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1879"></a> If you do
            not encode each of these as their respective entity
            references, then an SGML parser or application is
            likely to interpret them as characters introducing
            elements or entities (an XML parser will always
            interpret them this way); consequently, they won't
            appear as you intended. If you wish to cite text that
            contains literal ampersands and less-than signs, you
            need to transform these two characters into entity
            references before they are included in a DocBook
            document. The only other alternative is to incorporate
            text that includes them in your document through some
            process that avoids the parser.</p>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1893"></a> <a class=
            "indexterm" name="d0e1897"></a> In SGML, character
            entities are frequently declared using a third entity
            category (one that we deliberately chose to overlook),
            called <i>data entities</i>. In XML, these are declared
            using numeric character references. Numeric character
            references resemble entity references, but technically
            aren't the same. They have the form
            <tt>&amp;#<i><tt>999</tt></i>;</tt>, in which
            &#8220;999&#8221; is the numeric character number.</p>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1918"></a> <a class=
            "indexterm" name="d0e1924"></a> In XML, the numeric
            character number is always the Unicode character
            number. In addition, XML allows hexadecimal numeric
            character references of the form
            <tt>&amp;#x<i><tt>hhhh</tt></i>;</tt>. In SGML, the
            numeric character number is a number from the document
            character set that's declared in the SGML
            declaration.</p>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1948"></a> Character
            entities are also used to give a name to special
            characters that can't otherwise be typed or are not
            portable across applications and operating systems. You
            can then include these characters in your document by
            refering to their entity name. Instead of using the
            often obscure and inconsistent key combinations of your
            particular word processor to type, say, an uppercase
            letter U with an umlaut (&#220;), you type in an entity
            for it instead. For instance, the entity for an
            uppercase letter U with an umlaut has been defined as
            the entity <tt>Uuml</tt>, so you would type in <tt
            class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;Uuml;</tt> to reference
            it instead of the actual character. The SGML
            application that eventually processes your document for
            presentation will match the entity to your platform's
            handling of special characters in order to render it
            appropriately.</p>

          example). Instead of beginning with an ampersand, they
          begin with a percent sign. Parameter entities are most
          frequently used to customize the DTD. For a detailed

            reference in an SGML document in a marked section.
            Marking sections is a mechanism for indicating that
            special processing should apply to a particular block
            of text. Marked sections are introduced by the special
            sequence <tt>&lt;![<i><tt>keyword</tt></i>[</tt> and
            end with <tt>]]&gt;</tt>. In SGML, marked sections can
            appear in both DTDs and document instances. In XML,
            they're only allowed in the DTD.<sup>[<a name="d0e2032"

            "indexterm" name="d0e2053"></a> <a class="indexterm"
            name="d0e2057"></a> The most common keywords are
            <tt>INCLUDE</tt>, which indicates that the text in the
            marked section should be included in the document;
            <tt>IGNORE</tt>, which indicates that the text in the
            marked section should be ignored (it completely
            disappears from the parsed document); and
            <tt>CDATA</tt>, which indicates that all markup
            characters within that section should be ignored except
            for the closing characters <tt>]]&gt;</tt>.</p>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2075"></a> In SGML,
            these keywords can be parameter entities. For example,
            you might declare the following parameter entity in
            your document:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;!ENTITY % draft "INCLUDE"&gt;
</pre>

            <p>Then you could put the sections of the document that
            are only applicable in a draft within marked
            sections:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;![%draft;[
&lt;para&gt;
This paragraph only appears in the draft version.
&lt;/para&gt;
]]&gt;
</pre>

            <p>When you're ready to print the final version, simply
            change the <tt>draft</tt> parameter entity
            declaration:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;!ENTITY % draft "IGNORE"&gt;

        <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2108"></a> DocBook is a
        very popular set of tags for describing books, articles,
        and other prose documents, particularly technical
        documentation. DocBook is defined using the native DTD
        syntax of SGML and XML. Like HTML, DocBook is an example of
        a markup language defined in SGML/XML.</p>

          <p>DocBook is almost 10 years old. It began in 1991 as a
          joint project of HaL Computer Systems and O'Reilly. Its
          popularity grew, and eventually it spawned its own
          maintenance organization, the Davenport Group. In
          mid-1998, it became a Technical Committee (TC) of the
          Organization for the Advancement of Structured
          Information Standards (OASIS).</p>

            designed and implemented by HaL Computer Systems and
            O'Reilly &amp; Associates around 1991. It was developed
            primarily to facilitate the exchange of UNIX
            documentation originally marked up in <b>troff</b>. Its
            design appears to have been based partly on input from
            SGML interchange projects conducted by the Unix
            International and Open Software Foundation
            consortia.</p>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2176"></a> When
            DocBook V1.1 was published, discussion about its
            revision and maintenance began in earnest in the
            Davenport Group, a forum created by O'Reilly for
            computer documentation producers. Version 1.2 was
            influenced strongly by Novell and Digital.</p>

            <p>In 1994, the Davenport Group became an officially
            chartered entity responsible for DocBook's maintenance.
            DocBook V1.2.2 was published simultaneously. The

            <p>Under the auspices of the Davenport Group, the
            DocBook DTD began to widen its scope. It was now being
            used by a much wider audience, and for new purposes,
            such as direct authoring with SGML-aware tools, and
            publishing directly to paper. As the largest users of
            DocBook, Novell and Sun had a heavy influence on its
            design.</p>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2237"></a> In order to
            help users manage change, the new Davenport charter
            established the following rules for DocBook
            releases:</p>

            <div class="itemizedlist">
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>
                  <p>Minor versions (&#8220;point releases&#8221;
                  such as V2.2) could add to the markup model, but
                  could not change it in a backward-incompatible
                  way. For example, a new kind of list element
                  could be added, but it would not be acceptable
                  for the existing itemized-list model to start
                  requiring two list items inside it instead of
                  only one. Thus, any document conforming to
                  version <i><tt>n</tt></i>.0 would also conform to
                  <i><tt>n</tt></i>.<i><tt>m</tt></i>.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Major versions (such as V3.0) could both add
                  to the markup model and make
                  backward-incompatible changes. However, the
                  changes would have to be announced in the last
                  major release.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Major-version introductions must be separated
                  by at least a year.</p>

            January 1997. After that time, although DocBook's
            audience continued to grow, many of the Davenport Group
            stalwarts became involved in the XML effort, and
            development slowed dramatically. The idea of creating
            an official XML-compliant version of DocBook was
            discussed, but not implemented. (For more detailed
            information about DocBook V3.0 and plans for subsequent
            versions, see <a href="appc.html" title=
            "DocBook Versions">Appendix&#160;C</a>.)</p>

            <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2304"></a> The
            sponsors wanted to close out Davenport in an orderly
            way to ensure that DocBook users would be supported. It
            was suggested that OASIS become DocBook's new home. An
            OASIS DocBook Technical Committee was formed in July,
            1998, with Eduardo Gutentag of Sun Microsystems as
            chair.</p>

            continuing the work started by the Davenport Group. The
            transition from Davenport to OASIS has been very
            smooth, in part because the core design team consists
            of essentially the same individuals (we all just
            changed hats).</p>

            <p>DocBook V3.1, published in February 1999, was the
            first OASIS release. It integrated a number of changes
            that had been &#8220;in the wings&#8221; for some
            time.</p>

            <p>In February of 2001, OASIS made DocBook SGML V4.1
            and DocBook XML V4.1.2 <a href=
            "http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/members/200102/msg00000.html"

             target="_top">Version 4.2</a> of the DocBook DTD, for
            both SGML and XML, was released in July 2002.</p>

            <p>The committee continues new DocBook development to
            ensure that the DTD continues to meet the needs of its
            users. Forthcoming and experimental work includes:</p>

          Some structured editors apply style to the document while
          it's being edited, using fonts and color to make the
          editing task easier, but this stylistic information is
          not stored in the actual SGML/XML document. Instead, it
          is provided by the editing application.</p>

          <p><sup>[<a name="ftn.d0e1052" href=
          "#d0e1052">2</a>]</sup> The distinction between
          appearance or presentation and structure or content is
          essential to SGML, but there is a way to specify the
          appearance of an SGML document: attach a stylesheet to
          it. There are several standards for such stylesheets:
          CSS, XSL, FOSIs, and DSSSL. See <a href="ch04.html"

          "Publishing DocBook Documents">Chapter&#160;4</a>.</p>

          <p><sup>[<a name="ftn.d0e1468" href=
          "#d0e1468">3</a>]</sup> In XML, this is written as
          <tt>&lt;xref/&gt;</tt>, as we'll see in the section <a
          href="ch02.html#ch02-typexml" title=
          "Typing an SGML Document">the section called

          "d0e1815"></a> In XML, these characters are fixed. In
          SGML, it is possible to change the markup start
          characters, but we won't consider that case here. If you
          change the markup start characters, you know what you're
          doing. While we're on the subject, in SGML, these
          characters only have their special meaning if they are
          followed by a name character. It is, in fact, valid in an
          <span class="emphasis"><em>SGML</em></span> (but not an
          XML) document to write &#8220;O'Reilly &amp;
          Associates&#8221; because the ampersand is not followed
          by a name character. Don't do this, however. <a class=

          "d0e1865"></a> The sequence of characters that end a
          marked section (see <a href="ch01.html#s-ms" title=
          "Marked sections">the section called &#8220;Marked
          sections&#8221;</a>), such as ]]&gt; must also be encoded
          with at least one entity reference if it is not being
          used to end a marked section. For this purpose, you can
          use the entity reference <tt class=
          "sgmltag-genentity">&amp;gt;</tt> for the final right
          angle bracket.</p>

          allowed in an XML document, but the keyword cannot be a
          parameter entity, and it must be typed literally. See the
          examples on this page.</p>
