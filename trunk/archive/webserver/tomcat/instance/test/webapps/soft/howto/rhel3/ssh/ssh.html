><P
>&#13;      Until the mid-1990s, there was no secure way to 
      log into and use a computer from a remote location on the internet.
      The unsecure method that was commonly used was to start a 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>telnet</I
> client on the local machine, which
      would then establish a telnet protocol link to the remote
      machine, after which a login program would be run and, if 
      successful, a shell session would be established.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The login program required the user to key in a username
      and password.  This type of authentication was acceptable 
      practice during the early days of internetworking, when
      most connections were within college campuses or between
      academic laboratories. There was really very little
      security, however, because neither the authentication 
      information nor message content was encrypted. Anyone
      with the ability to tap a communications circuit could
      eavesdrop or steal a password.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      An even less secure practice was the use of another internet
      service called <B
CLASS="command"
>rsh</B
>,
      or the remote shell,
      which was very similar to <B
CLASS="command"
>telnet</B
>,
      but which could be set up to establish a connection to a shell
      running on a remote system
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>without using a password</I
>.
      In this mode, the  application depended completely
      on trust; there was no authentication and no encryption. 
      A companion to <B
CLASS="command"
>rsh</B
> was 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>rcp</B
>, the remote copy command,
      which transferred files
      between systems with a similar lack of security.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Well before the internet was opened up to the world in the
      1990s, these practices were obsolete due to their 
      lack of security. With the advent of the World Wide Web there
      was an explosion of the number of machines connected to 
      the internet. There was a need to administer machines
      remotely, but this required secure connections. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;      A number of projects to develop secure replacements for 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>rsh</B
> and 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>rcp</B
>
      were mounted. The effort that succeeded and was rapidly
      adopted was that of the Finnish developer
      Tatu Yloenen. He named his products 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> and 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>scp</B
>,
      the secure shell and secure copy, respectively.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      These products were never open source, but they were
      offered free of charge to the Linux and OpenBSD 
      communities for a number of years. Because of the
      importance of this software, this arrangement was not
      satisfactory for the long term. The OpenSSH project
      was launched to create open source replacements for
      the proprietary ones. The OpenSSH versions of 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> and 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>scp</B
>
      have been distributed with OpenBSD and Linux for several
      years now.  
    </P
><P
>    
      With <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
>,
      you can log into a remote machine
      with a high degree of security.  All of the communications between
      your workstation and the remote system are encrypted, including
      a password if it is needed.  It is also possible to establish
      sessions with remote machines without providing a password, 
      in a way that is functionally identical to 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>rsh</B
>,
      except that this can be accomplished
      with nearly complete security.  This mode of operation and the process
      for setting it up will be described in the sections that follow..
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> command
      can also be used to set up an
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>encrypted tunnel</I
> between your workstation and
      an application running on a remote machine. This feature is especially
      useful when running an X-Windows application on the remote host.
      The following services are provided:

	    be compressed. This is especially useful over a slow connection.
	  </P

	    variable (a requirement

>&#13;      When two parties wish to exchange secret messages
      using traditional encryption
      methods (also known as <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>symmetric</I
>
      encryption), they must
      first exchange a secret key. Distributing keys reliably has always been
      a problem. With <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>public key </I
>encryption, it is not 
      necessary for the parties to share secret keys.  Instead, each party
      has a pair of keys: a private key and a public key.  Each party gives the
      other his public key.  Each party keeps his private key secret, never
      revealing it to anyone else. If a third party discovers one of the public
      keys, it is not a problem.  Public keys can be posted to the world with
      no loss of security.
    </P

>&#13;      In order to send a message, the author uses the recipient's public key
      to encrypt it.  Once encrypted, the only key that can decrypt it is
      the recipient's private key, and only the recipient knows that key.
      This is the method used by
      <B
CLASS="command"

      authentication.
    </P

>&#13;      When you call upon the <B

      on your machine to connect you
      to another machine, your <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
>
      sends a connection request
      to the <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
>
      on the remote machine.  The remote
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
>
      then generates a random number, encrypts it with
      your <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>public key</I
> and sends it back.  Your
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> then decrypts it using
      your <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>private key</I
>
      to reveal the original number.  Your 
      <B
CLASS="command"

      number back to the remote
      <B

>&#13;      There is a very convenient way that users of the Gnome desktop
      can set up <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> so that they
      can connect to remote machines without having to supply
      a username and password but with a high level of security.
      In order for this to work, <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
>
      depends on two related applications:
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-agent</B
> and
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-add</B
>.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      When you log into the Gnome desktop, the
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-agent</B
> authentication 
      agent is started automatically.  It continues to run
      for as long as you are logged into the desktop.  The
      mission of <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-agent</B
>
      is to use your private key to decrypt authentication
      messages sent to your
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> client by the remote
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> daemon.
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-agent</B
>
      is available to provide this service to any 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> started from your 
      desktop.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In order to send requests to
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-agent</B
> and to receive
      responses,
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> must have a communications
      channel. When <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-agent</B
>
      starts up, it creates a <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>unix domain socket</I
>
      for this purpose and writes the path-name of the socket to
      standard output. The parent process, which is the Gnome 
      desktop, receives this path-name and uses it as the value of
      the <CODE
CLASS="varname"
>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</CODE
> environment variable.
      The Gnome desktop is an ancestor to any process started
      from the desktop, including <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
>.
      Processes inherit all of the environment variables of their
      parents, hence <CODE
CLASS="varname"
>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</CODE
> is part of the
      environment of every <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> client
      that you run. By querying the value of this variable,
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> knows which socket
      to use to communicate with 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-agent</B
>.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-agent</B
>
      does not know your pass phrase, hence it cannot decrypt
      your private key.
      This is where 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-add</B
> comes in.
      After starting <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-agent</B
>,
      the Gnome desktop runs <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-add</B
>
      to ask you for your pass phrase, which it then uses 
      to decrypt your private key.  It passes the decrypted private
      key via the Unix domain socket
      to <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-agent</B
>, which
      caches it for future use.
      It is possible to run 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh-add</B
> several
      times, to add additional private keys to 
      the cache.

      initiate password-free connections from a workstation.  If you 
      connect to a server via ssh and then wish to initiate
      connections from that location to other machines, the workstation configuration
      will not work, because the gnome desktop is not accessible.
      An alternate configuration that uses <I
