<H1> 5. Writing the Commands in Rules </H1>
<!--docid::SEC52::-->
<P>

The commands of a rule consist of shell command lines to be executed one
by one.  Each command line must start with a tab, except that the first
command line may be attached to the target-and-prerequisites line with a
semicolon in between.  Blank lines and lines of just comments may appear
among the command lines; they are ignored.  (But beware, an apparently
"blank" line that begins with a tab is <EM>not</EM> blank!  It is an
empty command; see section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC64">5.8 Using Empty Commands</A>.)
</P><P>

Users use many different shell programs, but commands in makefiles are
always interpreted by `<TT>/bin/sh</TT>' unless the makefile specifies
otherwise.  See section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC54">Command Execution</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX152"></A>
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>
The shell that is in use determines whether comments can be written on
command lines, and what syntax they use.  When the shell is
`<TT>/bin/sh</TT>', a `<SAMP>#</SAMP>' starts a comment that extends to the end of
the line.  The `<SAMP>#</SAMP>' does not have to be at the beginning of a line.
Text on a line before a `<SAMP>#</SAMP>' is not part of the comment.

<H2> 5.1 Command Echoing </H2>
<!--docid::SEC53::-->
<P>

Normally <CODE>make</CODE> prints each command line before it is executed.
We call this <EM>echoing</EM> because it gives the appearance that you
are typing the commands yourself.
</P><P>

When a line starts with `<SAMP>@</SAMP>', the echoing of that line is suppressed.
The `<SAMP>@</SAMP>' is discarded before the command is passed to the shell.
Typically you would use this for a command whose only effect is to print
something, such as an <CODE>echo</CODE> command to indicate progress through
the makefile:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>@echo About to make distribution files
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX155"></A>
<A NAME="IDX156"></A>
<A NAME="IDX157"></A>
<A NAME="IDX158"></A>
When <CODE>make</CODE> is given the flag `<SAMP>-n</SAMP>' or `<SAMP>--just-print</SAMP>'
it only echoes commands, it won't execute them.  See section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC102">Summary of Options</A>.  In this case and only this case, even the
commands starting with `<SAMP>@</SAMP>' are printed.  This flag is useful for
finding out which commands <CODE>make</CODE> thinks are necessary without
actually doing them.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX159"></A>
<A NAME="IDX160"></A>
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>
<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
The `<SAMP>-s</SAMP>' or `<SAMP>--silent</SAMP>'
flag to <CODE>make</CODE> prevents all echoing, as if all commands
started with `<SAMP>@</SAMP>'.  A rule in the makefile for the special target
<CODE>.SILENT</CODE> without prerequisites has the same effect
(see section <A HREF="make_4.html#SEC44">Special Built-in Target Names</A>).
<CODE>.SILENT</CODE> is essentially obsolete since `<SAMP>@</SAMP>' is more flexible.</P><P>

<H2> 5.2 Command Execution </H2>
<!--docid::SEC54::-->
<P>

When it is time to execute commands to update a target, they are executed
by making a new subshell for each line.  (In practice, <CODE>make</CODE> may
take shortcuts that do not affect the results.)
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX163"></A>
<STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> this implies that shell commands such as <CODE>cd</CODE>
that set variables local to each process will not affect the following
command lines. <A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="make_fot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>  If you want to use <CODE>cd</CODE>
to affect the next command, put the two on a single line with a
semicolon between them.  Then <CODE>make</CODE> will consider them a single
command and pass them, together, to a shell which will execute them in
sequence.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>foo : bar/lose
        cd bar; gobble lose &#62; ../foo
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX164"></A>
<A NAME="IDX165"></A>
<A NAME="IDX166"></A>
<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>
<A NAME="IDX169"></A>
If you would like to split a single shell command into multiple lines of
text, you must use a backslash at the end of all but the last subline.
Such a sequence of lines is combined into a single line, by deleting the
backslash-newline sequences, before passing it to the shell.  Thus, the
following is equivalent to the preceding example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>foo : bar/lose
        cd bar;  \
        gobble lose &#62; ../foo
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX170"></A>
The program used as the shell is taken from the variable <CODE>SHELL</CODE>.
By default, the program `<TT>/bin/sh</TT>' is used.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX171"></A>
On MS-DOS, if <CODE>SHELL</CODE> is not set, the value of the variable
<CODE>COMSPEC</CODE> (which is always set) is used instead.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX172"></A>
The processing of lines that set the variable <CODE>SHELL</CODE> in Makefiles
is different on MS-DOS.  The stock shell, `<TT>command.com</TT>', is
ridiculously limited in its functionality and many users of <CODE>make</CODE>
tend to install a replacement shell.  Therefore, on MS-DOS, <CODE>make</CODE>
examines the value of <CODE>SHELL</CODE>, and changes its behavior based on
whether it points to a Unix-style or DOS-style shell.  This allows
reasonable functionality even if <CODE>SHELL</CODE> points to
`<TT>command.com</TT>'.
</P><P>

If <CODE>SHELL</CODE> points to a Unix-style shell, <CODE>make</CODE> on MS-DOS
additionally checks whether that shell can indeed be found; if not, it
ignores the line that sets <CODE>SHELL</CODE>.  In MS-DOS, GNU <CODE>make</CODE>
searches for the shell in the following places:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
In the precise place pointed to by the value of <CODE>SHELL</CODE>.  For
example, if the makefile specifies `<SAMP>SHELL = /bin/sh</SAMP>', <CODE>make</CODE>
will look in the directory `<TT>/bin</TT>' on the current drive.
<P>

<LI>
In the current directory.
<P>

<LI>
In each of the directories in the <CODE>PATH</CODE> variable, in order.
<P>

</OL>
<P>

In every directory it examines, <CODE>make</CODE> will first look for the
specific file (`<TT>sh</TT>' in the example above).  If this is not found,
it will also look in that directory for that file with one of the known
extensions which identify executable files.  For example `<TT>.exe</TT>',
`<TT>.com</TT>', `<TT>.bat</TT>', `<TT>.btm</TT>', `<TT>.sh</TT>', and some others.
</P><P>

If any of these attempts is successful, the value of <CODE>SHELL</CODE> will
be set to the full pathname of the shell as found.  However, if none of
these is found, the value of <CODE>SHELL</CODE> will not be changed, and thus
the line that sets it will be effectively ignored.  This is so
<CODE>make</CODE> will only support features specific to a Unix-style shell if
such a shell is actually installed on the system where <CODE>make</CODE> runs.
</P><P>

Note that this extended search for the shell is limited to the cases
where <CODE>SHELL</CODE> is set from the Makefile; if it is set in the
environment or command line, you are expected to set it to the full
pathname of the shell, exactly as things are on Unix.
</P><P>

The effect of the above DOS-specific processing is that a Makefile that
says `<SAMP>SHELL = /bin/sh</SAMP>' (as many Unix makefiles do), will work
on MS-DOS unaltered if you have e.g. `<TT>sh.exe</TT>' installed in some
directory along your <CODE>PATH</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX173"></A>
Unlike most variables, the variable <CODE>SHELL</CODE> is never set from the
environment.  This is because the <CODE>SHELL</CODE> environment variable is
used to specify your personal choice of shell program for interactive
use.  It would be very bad for personal choices like this to affect the
functioning of makefiles.  See section <A HREF="make_6.html#SEC76">Variables from the Environment</A>.  However, on MS-DOS and MS-Windows the value of
<CODE>SHELL</CODE> in the environment <STRONG>is</STRONG> used, since on those systems
most users do not set this variable, and therefore it is most likely set
specifically to be used by <CODE>make</CODE>.  On MS-DOS, if the setting of
<CODE>SHELL</CODE> is not suitable for <CODE>make</CODE>, you can set the variable
<CODE>MAKESHELL</CODE> to the shell that <CODE>make</CODE> should use; this will
override the value of <CODE>SHELL</CODE>.

<H2> 5.3 Parallel Execution </H2>
<!--docid::SEC55::-->
<P>

GNU <CODE>make</CODE> knows how to execute several commands at once.
Normally, <CODE>make</CODE> will execute only one command at a time, waiting
for it to finish before executing the next.  However, the `<SAMP>-j</SAMP>' or
`<SAMP>--jobs</SAMP>' option tells <CODE>make</CODE> to execute many commands
simultaneously.</P><P>

On MS-DOS, the `<SAMP>-j</SAMP>' option has no effect, since that system doesn't
support multi-processing.
</P><P>

If the `<SAMP>-j</SAMP>' option is followed by an integer, this is the number of
commands to execute at once; this is called the number of <EM>job slots</EM>.
If there is nothing looking like an integer after the `<SAMP>-j</SAMP>' option,
there is no limit on the number of job slots.  The default number of job
slots is one, which means serial execution (one thing at a time).
</P><P>

One unpleasant consequence of running several commands simultaneously is
that output generated by the commands appears whenever each command
sends it, so messages from different commands may be interspersed.
</P><P>

Another problem is that two processes cannot both take input from the
same device; so to make sure that only one command tries to take input
from the terminal at once, <CODE>make</CODE> will invalidate the standard
input streams of all but one running command.  This means that
attempting to read from standard input will usually be a fatal error (a
`<SAMP>Broken pipe</SAMP>' signal) for most child processes if there are
several.
<A NAME="IDX174"></A>
<A NAME="IDX175"></A>
</P><P>

It is unpredictable which command will have a valid standard input stream
(which will come from the terminal, or wherever you redirect the standard
input of <CODE>make</CODE>).  The first command run will always get it first, and
the first command started after that one finishes will get it next, and so
on.
</P><P>

We will change how this aspect of <CODE>make</CODE> works if we find a better
alternative.  In the mean time, you should not rely on any command using
standard input at all if you are using the parallel execution feature; but
if you are not using this feature, then standard input works normally in
all commands.
</P><P>

Finally, handling recursive <CODE>make</CODE> invocations raises issues.  For
more information on this, see
<A HREF="make_5.html#SEC61">Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>.
</P><P>

If a command fails (is killed by a signal or exits with a nonzero
status), and errors are not ignored for that command
(see section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC56">Errors in Commands</A>),
the remaining command lines to remake the same target will not be run.
If a command fails and the `<SAMP>-k</SAMP>' or `<SAMP>--keep-going</SAMP>'
option was not given
(see section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC102">Summary of Options</A>),
<CODE>make</CODE> aborts execution.  If make
terminates for any reason (including a signal) with child processes
running, it waits for them to finish before actually exiting.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX176"></A>
<A NAME="IDX177"></A>
<A NAME="IDX178"></A>
<A NAME="IDX179"></A>
<A NAME="IDX180"></A>
<A NAME="IDX181"></A>
When the system is heavily loaded, you will probably want to run fewer jobs
than when it is lightly loaded.  You can use the `<SAMP>-l</SAMP>' option to tell
<CODE>make</CODE> to limit the number of jobs to run at once, based on the load
average.  The `<SAMP>-l</SAMP>' or `<SAMP>--max-load</SAMP>'
option is followed by a floating-point number.  For
example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>-l 2.5
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will not let <CODE>make</CODE> start more than one job if the load average is
above 2.5.  The `<SAMP>-l</SAMP>' option with no following number removes the
load limit, if one was given with a previous `<SAMP>-l</SAMP>' option.</P><P>

More precisely, when <CODE>make</CODE> goes to start up a job, and it already has
at least one job running, it checks the current load average; if it is not
lower than the limit given with `<SAMP>-l</SAMP>', <CODE>make</CODE> waits until the load
average goes below that limit, or until all the other jobs finish.
</P><P>

By default, there is no load limit.

<H2> 5.4 Errors in Commands </H2>
<!--docid::SEC56::-->
<P>

After each shell command returns, <CODE>make</CODE> looks at its exit status.
If the command completed successfully, the next command line is executed
in a new shell; after the last command line is finished, the rule is
finished.
</P><P>

If there is an error (the exit status is nonzero), <CODE>make</CODE> gives up on
the current rule, and perhaps on all rules.
</P><P>

Sometimes the failure of a certain command does not indicate a problem.
For example, you may use the <CODE>mkdir</CODE> command to ensure that a
directory exists.  If the directory already exists, <CODE>mkdir</CODE> will
report an error, but you probably want <CODE>make</CODE> to continue regardless.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX182"></A>
To ignore errors in a command line, write a `<SAMP>-</SAMP>' at the beginning of
the line's text (after the initial tab).  The `<SAMP>-</SAMP>' is discarded before
the command is passed to the shell for execution.
</P><P>

For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>clean:
        -rm -f *.o
</pre></td></tr></table><A NAME="IDX183"></A>
</P><P>

This causes <CODE>rm</CODE> to continue even if it is unable to remove a file.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX184"></A>
<A NAME="IDX185"></A>
<A NAME="IDX186"></A>
When you run <CODE>make</CODE> with the `<SAMP>-i</SAMP>' or `<SAMP>--ignore-errors</SAMP>'
flag, errors are ignored in all commands of all rules.  A rule in the
makefile for the special target <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE> has the same effect, if
there are no prerequisites.  These ways of ignoring errors are obsolete
because `<SAMP>-</SAMP>' is more flexible.
</P><P>

When errors are to be ignored, because of either a `<SAMP>-</SAMP>' or the
`<SAMP>-i</SAMP>' flag, <CODE>make</CODE> treats an error return just like success,
except that it prints out a message that tells you the status code
the command exited with, and says that the error has been ignored.
</P><P>

When an error happens that <CODE>make</CODE> has not been told to ignore,
it implies that the current target cannot be correctly remade, and neither
can any other that depends on it either directly or indirectly.  No further
commands will be executed for these targets, since their preconditions
have not been achieved.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX187"></A>
<A NAME="IDX188"></A>
Normally <CODE>make</CODE> gives up immediately in this circumstance, returning a
nonzero status.  However, if the `<SAMP>-k</SAMP>' or `<SAMP>--keep-going</SAMP>'
flag is specified, <CODE>make</CODE>
continues to consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets,
remaking them if necessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status.
For example, after an error in compiling one object file, `<SAMP>make -k</SAMP>'
will continue compiling other object files even though it already knows
that linking them will be impossible.  See section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC102">Summary of Options</A>.
</P><P>

The usual behavior assumes that your purpose is to get the specified
targets up to date; once <CODE>make</CODE> learns that this is impossible, it
might as well report the failure immediately.  The `<SAMP>-k</SAMP>' option says
that the real purpose is to test as many of the changes made in the
program as possible, perhaps to find several independent problems so
that you can correct them all before the next attempt to compile.  This
is why Emacs' <CODE>compile</CODE> command passes the `<SAMP>-k</SAMP>' flag by
default.

Usually when a command fails, if it has changed the target file at all,
the file is corrupted and cannot be used--or at least it is not
completely updated.  Yet the file's time stamp says that it is now up to
date, so the next time <CODE>make</CODE> runs, it will not try to update that
file.  The situation is just the same as when the command is killed by a
signal; see section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC57">5.5 Interrupting or Killing <CODE>make</CODE></A>.  So generally the right thing to do is to
delete the target file if the command fails after beginning to change
the file.  <CODE>make</CODE> will do this if <CODE>.DELETE_ON_ERROR</CODE> appears
as a target.  This is almost always what you want <CODE>make</CODE> to do, but
it is not historical practice; so for compatibility, you must explicitly
request it.

<H2> 5.5 Interrupting or Killing <CODE>make</CODE> </H2>
<!--docid::SEC57::-->
<P>

If <CODE>make</CODE> gets a fatal signal while a command is executing, it may
delete the target file that the command was supposed to update.  This is
done if the target file's last-modification time has changed since
<CODE>make</CODE> first checked it.
</P><P>

The purpose of deleting the target is to make sure that it is remade from
scratch when <CODE>make</CODE> is next run.  Why is this?  Suppose you type
<KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> while a compiler is running, and it has begun to write an
object file `<TT>foo.o</TT>'.  The <KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> kills the compiler, resulting
in an incomplete file whose last-modification time is newer than the source
file `<TT>foo.c</TT>'.  But <CODE>make</CODE> also receives the <KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> signal
and deletes this incomplete file.  If <CODE>make</CODE> did not do this, the next
invocation of <CODE>make</CODE> would think that `<TT>foo.o</TT>' did not require
updating--resulting in a strange error message from the linker when it
tries to link an object file half of which is missing.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX194"></A>
You can prevent the deletion of a target file in this way by making the
special target <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE> depend on it.  Before remaking a target,
<CODE>make</CODE> checks to see whether it appears on the prerequisites of
<CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE>, and thereby decides whether the target should be deleted
if a signal happens.  Some reasons why you might do this are that the
target is updated in some atomic fashion, or exists only to record a
modification-time (its contents do not matter), or must exist at all
times to prevent other sorts of trouble.

<H2> 5.6 Recursive Use of <CODE>make</CODE> </H2>
<!--docid::SEC58::-->
<P>

Recursive use of <CODE>make</CODE> means using <CODE>make</CODE> as a command in a
makefile.  This technique is useful when you want separate makefiles for
various subsystems that compose a larger system.  For example, suppose you
have a subdirectory `<TT>subdir</TT>' which has its own makefile, and you would
like the containing directory's makefile to run <CODE>make</CODE> on the
subdirectory.  You can do it by writing this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>subsystem:
        cd subdir &#38;&#38; $(MAKE)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

or, equivalently, this (see section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC102">Summary of Options</A>):
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>subsystem:
        $(MAKE) -C subdir
</pre></td></tr></table><A NAME="IDX195"></A>
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
</P><P>

You can write recursive <CODE>make</CODE> commands just by copying this example,
but there are many things to know about how they work and why, and about
how the sub-<CODE>make</CODE> relates to the top-level <CODE>make</CODE>.  You may
also find it useful to declare targets that invoke recursive
<CODE>make</CODE> commands as `<SAMP>.PHONY</SAMP>' (for more discussion on when
this is useful, see <A HREF="make_4.html#SEC41">4.6 Phony Targets</A>).
</P><P>

For your convenience, GNU <CODE>make</CODE> sets the variable <CODE>CURDIR</CODE> to
the pathname of the current working directory for you.  If <CODE>-C</CODE> is
in effect, it will contain the path of the new directory, not the
original.  The value has the same precedence it would have if it were
set in the makefile (by default, an environment variable <CODE>CURDIR</CODE>
will not override this value).  Note that setting this variable has no
effect on the operation of <CODE>make</CODE>

<H3> 5.6.1 How the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> Variable Works </H3>
<!--docid::SEC59::-->
<P>

Recursive <CODE>make</CODE> commands should always use the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE>,
not the explicit command name `<SAMP>make</SAMP>', as shown here:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>subsystem:
        cd subdir &#38;&#38; $(MAKE)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The value of this variable is the file name with which <CODE>make</CODE> was
invoked.  If this file name was `<TT>/bin/make</TT>', then the command executed
is `<SAMP>cd subdir &#38;&#38; /bin/make</SAMP>'.  If you use a special version of
<CODE>make</CODE> to run the top-level makefile, the same special version will be
executed for recursive invocations.
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
As a special feature, using the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE> in the commands of
a rule alters the effects of the `<SAMP>-t</SAMP>' (`<SAMP>--touch</SAMP>'), `<SAMP>-n</SAMP>'
(`<SAMP>--just-print</SAMP>'), or `<SAMP>-q</SAMP>' (`<SAMP>--question</SAMP>') option.
Using the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> variable has the same effect as using a `<SAMP>+</SAMP>'
character at the beginning of the command line.  See section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC98">Instead of Executing the Commands</A>.</P><P>

Consider the command `<SAMP>make -t</SAMP>' in the above example.  (The
`<SAMP>-t</SAMP>' option marks targets as up to date without actually running
any commands; see <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC98">9.3 Instead of Executing the Commands</A>.)  Following the usual
definition of `<SAMP>-t</SAMP>', a `<SAMP>make -t</SAMP>' command in the example would
create a file named `<TT>subsystem</TT>' and do nothing else.  What you
really want it to do is run `<SAMP>cd subdir &#38;&#38; make -t</SAMP>'; but that would
require executing the command, and `<SAMP>-t</SAMP>' says not to execute
commands.<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>
</P><P>

The special feature makes this do what you want: whenever a command
line of a rule contains the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE>, the flags `<SAMP>-t</SAMP>',
`<SAMP>-n</SAMP>' and `<SAMP>-q</SAMP>' do not apply to that line.  Command lines
containing <CODE>MAKE</CODE> are executed normally despite the presence of a
flag that causes most commands not to be run.  The usual
<CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> mechanism passes the flags to the sub-<CODE>make</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC61">Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>), so your request to touch the files, or print the
commands, is propagated to the subsystem.</P><P>

<H3> 5.6.2 Communicating Variables to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE> </H3>
<!--docid::SEC60::-->
<P>

Variable values of the top-level <CODE>make</CODE> can be passed to the
sub-<CODE>make</CODE> through the environment by explicit request.  These
variables are defined in the sub-<CODE>make</CODE> as defaults, but do not
override what is specified in the makefile used by the sub-<CODE>make</CODE>
makefile unless you use the `<SAMP>-e</SAMP>' switch (see section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC102">Summary of Options</A>).</P><P>

To pass down, or <EM>export</EM>, a variable, <CODE>make</CODE> adds the variable
and its value to the environment for running each command.  The
sub-<CODE>make</CODE>, in turn, uses the environment to initialize its table
of variable values.  See section <A HREF="make_6.html#SEC76">Variables from the Environment</A>.
</P><P>

Except by explicit request, <CODE>make</CODE> exports a variable only if it
is either defined in the environment initially or set on the command
line, and if its name consists only of letters, numbers, and underscores.
Some shells cannot cope with environment variable names consisting of
characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores.
</P><P>

The special variables <CODE>SHELL</CODE> and <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> are always
exported (unless you unexport them).
<CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> is exported if you set it to anything.
</P><P>

<CODE>make</CODE> automatically passes down variable values that were defined
on the command line, by putting them in the <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> variable.
See section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC61">5.6.3 Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>.
</P><P>

Variables are <EM>not</EM> normally passed down if they were created by
default by <CODE>make</CODE> (see section <A HREF="make_10.html#SEC106">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>).  The sub-<CODE>make</CODE> will define these for
itself.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
If you want to export specific variables to a sub-<CODE>make</CODE>, use the
<CODE>export</CODE> directive, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>export <VAR>variable</VAR> <small>...</small>
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX203"></A>
If you want to <EM>prevent</EM> a variable from being exported, use the
<CODE>unexport</CODE> directive, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>unexport <VAR>variable</VAR> <small>...</small>
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In both of these forms, the arguments to <CODE>export</CODE> and
<CODE>unexport</CODE> are expanded, and so could be variables or functions
which expand to a (list of) variable names to be (un)exported.
</P><P>

As a convenience, you can define a variable and export it at the same
time by doing:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>export <VAR>variable</VAR> = value
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

has the same result as:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre><VAR>variable</VAR> = value
export <VAR>variable</VAR>
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

and
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>export <VAR>variable</VAR> := value
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

has the same result as:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre><VAR>variable</VAR> := value
export <VAR>variable</VAR>
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Likewise,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>export <VAR>variable</VAR> += value
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is just like:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre><VAR>variable</VAR> += value
export <VAR>variable</VAR>
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

See section <A HREF="make_6.html#SEC73">Appending More Text to Variables</A>.
</P><P>

You may notice that the <CODE>export</CODE> and <CODE>unexport</CODE> directives
work in <CODE>make</CODE> in the same way they work in the shell, <CODE>sh</CODE>.
</P><P>

If you want all variables to be exported by default, you can use
<CODE>export</CODE> by itself:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>export
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This tells <CODE>make</CODE> that variables which are not explicitly mentioned
in an <CODE>export</CODE> or <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive should be exported.
Any variable given in an <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive will still <EM>not</EM>
be exported.  If you use <CODE>export</CODE> by itself to export variables by
default, variables whose names contain characters other than
alphanumerics and underscores will not be exported unless specifically
mentioned in an <CODE>export</CODE> directive.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
The behavior elicited by an <CODE>export</CODE> directive by itself was the
default in older versions of GNU <CODE>make</CODE>.  If your makefiles depend
on this behavior and you want to be compatible with old versions of
<CODE>make</CODE>, you can write a rule for the special target
<CODE>.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES</CODE> instead of using the <CODE>export</CODE> directive.
This will be ignored by old <CODE>make</CODE>s, while the <CODE>export</CODE>
directive will cause a syntax error.<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
</P><P>

Likewise, you can use <CODE>unexport</CODE> by itself to tell <CODE>make</CODE>
<EM>not</EM> to export variables by default.  Since this is the default
behavior, you would only need to do this if <CODE>export</CODE> had been used
by itself earlier (in an included makefile, perhaps).  You
<STRONG>cannot</STRONG> use <CODE>export</CODE> and <CODE>unexport</CODE> by themselves to
have variables exported for some commands and not for others.  The last
<CODE>export</CODE> or <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive that appears by itself
determines the behavior for the entire run of <CODE>make</CODE>.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
As a special feature, the variable <CODE>MAKELEVEL</CODE> is changed when it
is passed down from level to level.  This variable's value is a string
which is the depth of the level as a decimal number.  The value is
`<SAMP>0</SAMP>' for the top-level <CODE>make</CODE>; `<SAMP>1</SAMP>' for a sub-<CODE>make</CODE>,
`<SAMP>2</SAMP>' for a sub-sub-<CODE>make</CODE>, and so on.  The incrementation
happens when <CODE>make</CODE> sets up the environment for a command.</P><P>

The main use of <CODE>MAKELEVEL</CODE> is to test it in a conditional
directive (see section <A HREF="make_7.html#SEC79">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</A>); this
way you can write a makefile that behaves one way if run recursively and
another way if run directly by you.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
You can use the variable <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> to cause all sub-<CODE>make</CODE>
commands to use additional makefiles.  The value of <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> is
a whitespace-separated list of file names.  This variable, if defined in
the outer-level makefile, is passed down through the environment; then
it serves as a list of extra makefiles for the sub-<CODE>make</CODE> to read
before the usual or specified ones.  See section <A HREF="make_3.html#SEC17">The Variable <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE></A>.</P><P>

Flags such as `<SAMP>-s</SAMP>' and `<SAMP>-k</SAMP>' are passed automatically to the
sub-<CODE>make</CODE> through the variable <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE>.  This variable is
set up automatically by <CODE>make</CODE> to contain the flag letters that
<CODE>make</CODE> received.  Thus, if you do `<SAMP>make -ks</SAMP>' then
<CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> gets the value `<SAMP>ks</SAMP>'.</P><P>

As a consequence, every sub-<CODE>make</CODE> gets a value for <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE>
in its environment.  In response, it takes the flags from that value and

The `<SAMP>-j</SAMP>' option is a special case (see section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC55">Parallel Execution</A>).
If you set it to some numeric value `<SAMP>N</SAMP>' and your operating system

ensure that there are only `<SAMP>N</SAMP>' jobs running at the same time
between them all.  Note that any job that is marked recursive
(see section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC98">Instead of Executing the Commands</A>)
doesn't count against the total jobs (otherwise we could get `<SAMP>N</SAMP>'
sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s running and have no slots left over for any real work!)
</P><P>

If your operating system doesn't support the above communication, then
`<SAMP>-j 1</SAMP>' is always put into <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> instead of the value you
specified.  This is because if the `<SAMP>-j</SAMP>' option were passed down
to sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s, you would get many more jobs running in parallel
than you asked for.  If you give `<SAMP>-j</SAMP>' with no numeric argument,
meaning to run as many jobs as possible in parallel, this is passed
down, since multiple infinities are no more than one.</P><P>

If you do not want to pass the other flags down, you must change the
value of <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE>, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>subsystem:
        cd subdir &#38;&#38; $(MAKE) MAKEFLAGS=
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX231"></A>
The command line variable definitions really appear in the variable
<CODE>MAKEOVERRIDES</CODE>, and <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> contains a reference to this
variable.  If you do want to pass flags down normally, but don't want to
pass down the command line variable definitions, you can reset
<CODE>MAKEOVERRIDES</CODE> to empty, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>MAKEOVERRIDES =
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX232"></A>
<A NAME="IDX233"></A>
This is not usually useful to do.  However, some systems have a small
fixed limit on the size of the environment, and putting so much
information into the value of <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> can exceed it.  If you
see the error message `<SAMP>Arg list too long</SAMP>', this may be the problem.
<A NAME="IDX234"></A>
<A NAME="IDX235"></A>
(For strict compliance with POSIX.2, changing <CODE>MAKEOVERRIDES</CODE> does
not affect <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> if the special target `<SAMP>.POSIX</SAMP>' appears
in the makefile.  You probably do not care about this.)
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX236"></A>
A similar variable <CODE>MFLAGS</CODE> exists also, for historical
compatibility.  It has the same value as <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> except that it
does not contain the command line variable definitions, and it always
begins with a hyphen unless it is empty (<CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> begins with a
hyphen only when it begins with an option that has no single-letter
version, such as `<SAMP>--warn-undefined-variables</SAMP>').  <CODE>MFLAGS</CODE> was
traditionally used explicitly in the recursive <CODE>make</CODE> command, like
this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>subsystem:
        cd subdir &#38;&#38; $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

but now <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> makes this usage redundant.  If you want your
makefiles to be compatible with old <CODE>make</CODE> programs, use this
technique; it will work fine with more modern <CODE>make</CODE> versions too.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX237"></A>
<A NAME="IDX238"></A>
<A NAME="IDX239"></A>
<A NAME="IDX240"></A>
The <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> variable can also be useful if you want to have
certain options, such as `<SAMP>-k</SAMP>' (see section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC102">Summary of Options</A>), set each time you run <CODE>make</CODE>.  You simply put a value for
<CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> in your environment.  You can also set <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> in
a makefile, to specify additional flags that should also be in effect for
that makefile.  (Note that you cannot use <CODE>MFLAGS</CODE> this way.  That
variable is set only for compatibility; <CODE>make</CODE> does not interpret a
value you set for it in any way.)
</P><P>

When <CODE>make</CODE> interprets the value of <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> (either from the
environment or from a makefile), it first prepends a hyphen if the value
does not already begin with one.  Then it chops the value into words
separated by blanks, and parses these words as if they were options given
on the command line (except that `<SAMP>-C</SAMP>', `<SAMP>-f</SAMP>', `<SAMP>-h</SAMP>',
`<SAMP>-o</SAMP>', `<SAMP>-W</SAMP>', and their long-named versions are ignored; and there
is no error for an invalid option).
</P><P>

If you do put <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> in your environment, you should be sure not
to include any options that will drastically affect the actions of
<CODE>make</CODE> and undermine the purpose of makefiles and of <CODE>make</CODE>
itself.  For instance, the `<SAMP>-t</SAMP>', `<SAMP>-n</SAMP>', and `<SAMP>-q</SAMP>' options, if
put in one of these variables, could have disastrous consequences and would
certainly have at least surprising and probably annoying effects.</P><P>

<H3> 5.6.4 The `<SAMP>--print-directory</SAMP>' Option </H3>
<!--docid::SEC62::-->
<P>

If you use several levels of recursive <CODE>make</CODE> invocations, the
`<SAMP>-w</SAMP>' or `<SAMP>--print-directory</SAMP>' option can make the output a
lot easier to understand by showing each directory as <CODE>make</CODE>
starts processing it and as <CODE>make</CODE> finishes processing it.  For
example, if `<SAMP>make -w</SAMP>' is run in the directory `<TT>/u/gnu/make</TT>',
<CODE>make</CODE> will print a line of the form:</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>make: Entering directory `/u/gnu/make'.
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

before doing anything else, and a line of the form:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>make: Leaving directory `/u/gnu/make'.
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

when processing is completed.

Normally, you do not need to specify this option because `<SAMP>make</SAMP>'

`<SAMP>-C</SAMP>' option, and in sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s.  <CODE>make</CODE> will not
automatically turn on `<SAMP>-w</SAMP>' if you also use `<SAMP>-s</SAMP>', which says to
be silent, or if you use `<SAMP>--no-print-directory</SAMP>' to explicitly

<H2> 5.7 Defining Canned Command Sequences </H2>
<!--docid::SEC63::-->
<P>

When the same sequence of commands is useful in making various targets, you
can define it as a canned sequence with the <CODE>define</CODE> directive, and
refer to the canned sequence from the rules for those targets.  The canned
sequence is actually a variable, so the name must not conflict with other
variable names.
</P><P>

Here is an example of defining a canned sequence of commands:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>define run-yacc
yacc $(firstword $^)
mv y.tab.c $@
endef
</pre></td></tr></table><A NAME="IDX251"></A>
</P><P>

Here <CODE>run-yacc</CODE> is the name of the variable being defined;
<CODE>endef</CODE> marks the end of the definition; the lines in between are the
commands.  The <CODE>define</CODE> directive does not expand variable references
and function calls in the canned sequence; the `<SAMP>$</SAMP>' characters,
parentheses, variable names, and so on, all become part of the value of the
variable you are defining.
See section <A HREF="make_6.html#SEC75">Defining Variables Verbatim</A>,
for a complete explanation of <CODE>define</CODE>.
</P><P>

The first command in this example runs Yacc on the first prerequisite of
whichever rule uses the canned sequence.  The output file from Yacc is
always named `<TT>y.tab.c</TT>'.  The second command moves the output to the
rule's target file name.
</P><P>

To use the canned sequence, substitute the variable into the commands of a
rule.  You can substitute it like any other variable
(see section <A HREF="make_6.html#SEC66">Basics of Variable References</A>).
Because variables defined by <CODE>define</CODE> are recursively expanded
variables, all the variable references you wrote inside the <CODE>define</CODE>
are expanded now.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>foo.c : foo.y
        $(run-yacc)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

`<SAMP>foo.y</SAMP>' will be substituted for the variable `<SAMP>$^</SAMP>' when it occurs in
<CODE>run-yacc</CODE>'s value, and `<SAMP>foo.c</SAMP>' for `<SAMP>$@</SAMP>'.</P><P>

This is a realistic example, but this particular one is not needed in
practice because <CODE>make</CODE> has an implicit rule to figure out these
commands based on the file names involved
(see section <A HREF="make_10.html#SEC103">Using Implicit Rules</A>).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX252"></A>
<A NAME="IDX253"></A>
<A NAME="IDX254"></A>
In command execution, each line of a canned sequence is treated just as
if the line appeared on its own in the rule, preceded by a tab.  In
particular, <CODE>make</CODE> invokes a separate subshell for each line.  You
can use the special prefix characters that affect command lines
(`<SAMP>@</SAMP>', `<SAMP>-</SAMP>', and `<SAMP>+</SAMP>') on each line of a canned sequence.
See section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC52">Writing the Commands in Rules</A>.
For example, using this canned sequence:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>define frobnicate
@echo "frobnicating target $@"
frob-step-1 $&#60; -o $@-step-1
frob-step-2 $@-step-1 -o $@
endef
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<CODE>make</CODE> will not echo the first line, the <CODE>echo</CODE> command.
But it <EM>will</EM> echo the following two command lines.
</P><P>

On the other hand, prefix characters on the command line that refers to
a canned sequence apply to every line in the sequence.  So the rule:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>frob.out: frob.in
        @$(frobnicate)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

does not echo <EM>any</EM> commands.
(See section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC53">Command Echoing</A>, for a full explanation of `<SAMP>@</SAMP>'.)

<H2> 5.8 Using Empty Commands </H2>
<!--docid::SEC64::-->
<P>

It is sometimes useful to define commands which do nothing.  This is done
simply by giving a command that consists of nothing but whitespace.  For
example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>target: ;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

defines an empty command string for `<TT>target</TT>'.  You could also use a
line beginning with a tab character to define an empty command string,
but this would be confusing because such a line looks empty.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX255"></A>
You may be wondering why you would want to define a command string that
does nothing.  The only reason this is useful is to prevent a target
from getting implicit commands (from implicit rules or the
<CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> special target; see section <A HREF="make_10.html#SEC103">10. Using Implicit Rules</A> and
see section <A HREF="make_10.html#SEC115">Defining Last-Resort Default Rules</A>).</P><P>

You may be inclined to define empty command strings for targets that are
not actual files, but only exist so that their prerequisites can be
remade.  However, this is not the best way to do that, because the
prerequisites may not be remade properly if the target file actually does exist.
See section <A HREF="make_4.html#SEC41">Phony Targets</A>, for a better way to do this.
