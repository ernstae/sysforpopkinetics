>&#13;      RFPK uses the same operating system for the v20z as for

      (a.k.a. whitechuck), for <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>webserver</I
>
      and for development workstations.
      The operating system is RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Workstation
      Edition. At present, the v20z is the only RFPK computer with
      64-bit processors, however, hence the AMD64 version rather than
      the x86 version of RHEL should be used for it.
    </P

>&#13;      RHEL can be kept
      up-to-date by simply using the RHN <B

>up2date</B
>
      utility.  If, however, it should
      become necessary to install the software again from scratch, the following
      procedure can be followed:

	    The v20z was previously registered with RHN and,
	    consequently, RHN has in its database a description of the hardware
	    and software in the system.  Because we are going to change the
	    software, we start by deleting the profile currently in the 
	    RHN database.
