USER VISIBLE CHANGES
The user no longer receives a Bugzilla report when
an SpkException is caught.

The outer most catch block was printing out error messages to
the standard error, which in turn was triggering the CSPK daemon to
submit a bugzilla report.  Fixed so that the messages are directed
to result.xml.
