>Introduction</H2
><P
>&#13;      The client component of Spk, called the Model Design Agent (MDA), is
      written in the Java language.  It communicates with the rest of the
      system via the Internet, using the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>http</I
>
      and <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>https</I
> protocols.  On the
      server side of this communication is a web server, which is software
      that supports World Wide Web functionality and runs continuously in a server machine.
      The fact that the MDA is a Java application makes it very desirable
      that the components that communicate with the MDA from the server side
      be also written in Java. Server-side Java components such as those
      in Spk are known as <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Java servlets</I
>. A closely related
      technology, called 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Java Server Pages (JSP)</I
>, is an extensible set of 
      extensions to HTML which can be used to generate servlets.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In order to run servlets and JSP within a web server, software known as
      a <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>servlet/JSP container</I
> is required.  Tomcat, a
      free product of the Catalina project, which in turn is part of the
      Jakarta project sponsored by Apache, the leading developer of web
      server software, serves this purpose for Spk.  Tomcat can be added
      to an Apache web server, in which case it provides only the 
      servlet/JSP container function, or it can be installed as a complete
      stand-alone web server and servlet/JSP container.  For the purposes of Spk,
      the latter is the simpler solution.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The rest of this document describes the installation and configuration
      of tomcat for Spk.

>Tomcat Instances and Web Applications</H2
><P
>&#13;      It is possible to run several copies of Tomcat simultaneously.  Each 
      independently running copy is called an <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>instance</I
>.
      As will be explained, shortly, an Spk installation requires four
      Tomcat instances.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      A Tomcat instance expects to find its configuration information, as well
      as its applications, in a file hierarchy of a
      certain, predetermined structure.  One of the directories, called 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>webapps</TT
>, contains one or more web applications, 
      also known as <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>contexts</I
>.  
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Like all web servers, Tomcat receives requests formatted either to the
      standards of the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>http</I
> protocol or to the
      encrypted <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>https</I
> protocol.  The latter is also
      known as the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>secure socket layer (SSL)</I
>.  A 
      Tomcat instance can designate one tcp port for http and another one for
      https.  Most often, port 80 is used for http and port 443 for https, but
      any other port numbers can be used instead.  For Spk, we use 
      80 and 443 for the production ports; 8080 and 8443 for test ports.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      From a reliability point of view, it is absolutely essential to have a web
      for testing that is identical to the 
      web server used for production.  The simplest way to achieve this is
      to have a production instance and a test instance of the same software
      running on the same machine.  This is the approach that we take with
      Spk.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Most of the Spk web site must be run in the secure SSL mode, in order to
      protect the privacy of patient data and proprietary nature of some of the
      PK models.  We absolutely do not want users to be able to access certain
      web pages using only the ordinary http protocol.  With Tomcat,
      unfortunately, there is no way (or at least none that we have discovered)
      to keep a user from accessing, with http, the pages intended only for https, if
      both http and https ports are configured for the same instance.  For this
      reason, an Spk installation requires four instances, rather than two.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The four instances are:

>&#13;      When changes are made to a Java web application, it is very easy to deploy
      the modified application to a Tomcat instance if the application is organized
      in a certain predetermined hierarchy of directories and files. A special 
      compressed archive format, known as a Web Archive (war), has been defined
      for compressing such an archive into a single file, for easy transport and
      storage.  These files normally carry a <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.war</TT
> file
      name suffix, and are very similar to the more familiar
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.zip</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.tar</TT
> and, especially,
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.jar</TT
> files.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      When a <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.war</TT
> file is copied into the
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>webapps</TT
> directory of a Tomcat instance, it is 
      automatically parsed, translated, compiled and linked by Tomcat itself, replacing
      the existing version of the application, without any need to interrupt
      operations.  
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The web portion of Spk is divided into two web applications:
      <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>init</I
>, which consists of static content, informative
	    to everyone with an interest in Spk.  The authorship and maintenance of
	    this application is primarily the responsibility of the 
	    RFPK Science Team.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>user</I
>, which consists of dynamic content, including
	    user login, MDA launch, status and historical information about the 
	    jobs of a particular user.  The <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>user</I
> application
	    is the responsibility of the RFPK Software Team.
	  </P
></LI
></OL
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Both the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>init</I
> context and the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>user</I
>
      context are accessible exclusively via https. 
      The archives <TT
CLASS="filename"
>init.war</TT
> and 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>user.war</TT
> must be installed in the 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>webapps</TT
> directory of either of the production SSL
      instance or the test SSL instance, but never in the other two instances.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The two non-SSL instances contain only a trivial application which 
      redirects the user's browser to the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>init</I
> context on
      the associated SSL instance.  This redirection is transparent and 
      immediate, and should not normally be noticed by the user. The 
      redirection, however, allows users to initiate contact with Spk via the standard 
      non-secure URL 
      <A
HREF="http://spk.rfpk.washington.edu"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;	http://spk.rfpk.washington.edu

>&#13;      At present, it is not possible to run the production instance
      or the production SSL instance with any user other than
      root, because only root can open ports with numbers less
      than 1024. It might be more secure to run under an ordinary
      user, as does Apache, but that capability is not yet available.
      On the other hand, Tomcat may be less vulnerable to certain
      exploits, such as buffer overflows, because of Java's built-in
      protection of against such problems.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Although root must be the tomcat process owner,
      it is preferable for its files to belong to a user
      or users other than root.  That way, ordinary users can be given the authority
      to modify these files without having to know the root password.

>&#13;      Before you try to restart an instance that you have commanded to stop,
      be sure that it has actually terminated by using the piped command
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ps -ef | grep tom</B
> and counting entries. Sometimes
      it can take a while for an instance to clean up everything that
      it needs to before quitting.  If it has not died after 
      several minutes, you can use the
      <B
CLASS="command"
>kill -9 pid</B
> command, where <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>pid</I
>
      is the process id provided by <B
CLASS="command"
>ps</B
>. Because
      instances are started at boot time in the order
      <B
CLASS="command"
>prod</B
>,
      <B
CLASS="command"
>test</B
>,
      <B
CLASS="command"
>prodssl</B
>,
      <B
CLASS="command"
>testssl</B
>, 
      and hence are assigned monotonically increasing pids, it should 
      ordinarily be possible to decide which process to kill.  If an instance
      has already been stopped and restarted, however, it will have a pid
      greater than any of the processes that have been running since
      boot time. Whenever you restart an instance, it is a good idea to
      write down its pid, in order not to be confused later on.  In practice,
      <B
CLASS="command"
>testssl</B
> is the most likely instance to need
      restarting, and in that case there will not be a problem, because
      of the four instances, <B
CLASS="command"
>testssl</B
> has the greatest
      pid after boot.
