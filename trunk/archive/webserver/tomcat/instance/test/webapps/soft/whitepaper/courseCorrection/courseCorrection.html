>Lessons Learned from the Beta Release</H2
><P
>&#13;      During the 3rd quarter of 2002, the first beta-test release
      of SPK was distributed to six commercial partner firms, which
      were chosen for their prominence in the field of bio-kinetic software
      and consulting and for their interest in the project.  The expectation
      was that these firms would evaluate SPK by developing test models
      typical of their own work and by running these models on the SPK
      platform.  This was to be the first time that SPK was exercised
      outside of the University of Washington Bioengineering Department.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The results of the beta-test cycle were extremely discouraging.
      None of the partner firms was willing to expend the effort
      required to do an effective evaluation.  The feedback that
      RFPK received was that SPK is difficult to use, that the
      documentation needs a lot of improvement and that, in the
      opinion of one commercial partner, a Linux version would have
      been more interesting than the Microsoft Windows version
      supplied, because then it might have been possible to run it
      on a powerful Beowulf cluster.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      An analysis of this disappointing experience highlighted a
      number of possible problems:
      <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    SPK is quite difficult to use.  It was designed to serve
	    the needs of a particular class of user: namely scientists
	    who themselves are skilled C++ programmers, or scientists
	    who have professional C++ programmers at their disposal.
	    Such users seem to be rare indeed.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    It had been assumed that SPK would be developed
	    into commercial products by the partner firms.
	    The beta software was distributed to them without
	    a clear understanding of what they would have to
	    pay in terms of licensing fees.  There was no
	    guarantee that one of their competitors might not
	    obtain an exclusive license.  The future of RFPK
	    itself was uncertain, which naturally raised
	    questions about development and maintenance of the
	    software should funding dry up.  In retrospect,
	    it is not surprising that none of the selected firms
	    saw investing in the evaluation of SPK to be in its
	    interest, given these uncertainties.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    As a Microsoft Windows application, SPK was not
	    capable of being run on more powerful systems,
	    such as Beowulf clusters, Unix multiprocessors
	    and IBM mainframes.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    The fact that none of the six recipients of the beta
	    release saw fit to evaluate SPK does not prove that
	    there are no potential users in the scientific
	    community.  Results might have been different if
	    SPK had been distributed to a much wider audience.

      the most important changes that RFPK could make
      would be to dramatically increase the usability
      and availability of SPK to the scientific community.
      We decided that a multi-faceted approach would be
      the best means of achieving this:

	    Matlab, Octave, SAAM-II, S-Plus or R.

>&#13;	    Modify the SPK computational engine so that it can
	    efficiently utilize Beowulf clusters, Unix and

	    Develop client software to allow scientists to specify
	    models and to view and analyze results on whatever
	    workstations they prefer, including Windows,
	    Macintosh and Linux.

>&#13;      The new goals could, of course, be achieved in a number of ways.
      The course that we chose is based on a desire to harness the
      technology of the World Wide Web.  It is an understatement to
      point out that web technology has revolutionized the manner in
      which nearly everyone interacts with computers. Given the limited
      financial resources of RFPK, it is especially fortuitous that
      much of the web runs on free software.  RFPK can derive enormous
      leverage by utilizing free technology to transform SPK to a
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>three-tiered architecture</I
>
      similar to that used by most
      prominent web sites.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The SPK three-tiered architecture will consist of the following strata:

>&#13;	At present, SPK is a C++ class library.  By itself, it is
	not a computer program and can solve no problems.  It lacks
	a model and a model driver.  The scientist is expected to
	supply these elements in the form of C++ source code.
	Experience has shown this requirement to be unrealistic.
	In the enhanced architecture, the model and driver will be
	generated automatically, to the scientist's specification.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Scientists who build bio-kinetic models use a number of
	different languages and tools.  Principal among these
	are Nonmem, Matlab, Octave, S-Plus, R, and SAAM-II. These
	users should not be required to learn a completely new
	language in order to use SPK.  Requiring expertise in C++
	was not only unrealistic because of the difficulty of that
	language; it was also unrealistic because C++ is a language
	not normally used in bio-medical research.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	The specification for a kinetic model requires the definition
	of expressions and data.  The expressions represent mathematical
	functions such as the function for the mean, its derivative,
	or differential equations.  Data includes measurement data,
	parameters, and other descriptive information.  Each of the
	languages used to build or specify models has its unique syntax
	and characteristics.  For instance, Nonmem uses a Fortran-like
	syntax for expressions, providing these and other required
	information in Nonmen-specific <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>control files</I
>.
	SAAM-II has its	<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>study</I
>
	and <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>data</I
> files.  Matlab has its own
	expression syntax,
	and so forth.  SPK will allow users to specify models using the
	conventions with which they are familiar.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	As is true of most non-scientists, we can assume that the majority
	of scientists prefer to use Microsoft Windows to operate their
	workstations and laptops.  A significant minority, however, prefer
	the Macintosh, Unix or Linux.  Some use personal digital assistants.
	In the not-so-distant future, many will be running applications
	on their wireless phones.  In order to serve the largest possible
	group of researchers, the enhanced architecture will eventually
	support all of these operating environments.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	SPK will include Model Design Agents (MDA), which are easily
	installed programs with graphical user interfaces (GUI) that
	assist scientists to specify population kinetic models.  MDAs
	will be available for each of the supported modeling environments,
	including Nonmen, Matlab, Octave, S-Plus, R, and SAAM-II.  MDAs
	will be written using portable GUI development tools so that they
	will run with little or no modification on many operating systems,
	including Microsoft, Macintosh, Unix and Linux.
      </P

>&#13;	The first beta release of SPK included the capability of

	execution.  The recognition of this fact is certainly one of
	the most significant achievements of SPK to date.

>&#13;	Running SPK on a group of workstations working in parallel has

	first place, these workstations were purchased for other work,

	resources when it runs, thus making it impossible for other
	work to coexist with it.  In addition, managing the
	synchronization between machines of different capabilities and
	different usage patterns is complex and inefficient.  The
	exercise did, however, demonstrate the concept.  The lessons
	learned will be incorporated in the next iteration of the
	design, which will be targeted at clusters of similar Linux
	processors, under centralized control, and dedicated to
	computation.

      greatest possible impact, it would be highly desirable for
      developers outside of RFPK to share in the work.  We will
      actively pursue cooperative development by adopting the
      development methods of the open source community.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Given that the source code will be readily available, anyone
      with the requisite level of software development skill will be
      able to make or propose changes to any part of SPK.  In the
      enhanced architecture, however, areas that would be especially
      attractive for parallel development would be the
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>client tier</I
> and
      the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>reusable models.</I
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      We plan to provide a number of Model Design Agents (MDA) for the
      client tier.  Our list is by no means exhaustive.  Others may
      want agents that support languages and conventions different
      from those that we have selected.  They may wish to develop MDAs
      that they believe are more powerful or user-friendlier than
      ours.  In order to encourage the development of MDAs by other
      groups, RFPK will publish the specifications for the application
      protocols that comprise the interface between the MDAs and
      ASPKs.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      As described above, SPK will contain a library of reusable
      models, to which users can contribute.  This will be a very
      important avenue for cooperative efforts.

>Commercial Opportunities</H2
><P
>&#13;      Employing an open source license will eliminate the possibility
      of a commercial entity using SPK source code as the basis of a
      proprietary product.  This does not mean that there will not be
      commercial opportunities.  Indeed, the concept that commercial
      partners can earn profits while adding value to SPK has been an
      important aspect of the project since inception.  With the
      three-tier architecture, software firms will be able to develop
      and to market MDAs which conform to the interface protocol
      published by RFPK, as long as the products do not contain SPK
      code.  These MDAs might support additional languages not
      supported by other MDAs, or they might employ different user
      interface technologies.  Another important area of commercial
      opportunity would be the design of reusable models that would be
      offered for sale as products or as part of a service.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      There would also be an opportunity for 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>application service providers (ASP)</I
>
      to offer an SPK service to the research
      community.  (An ASP is a computer service bureau which sells
      access to specific applications which are run on its computer
      systems and which the customers access via the Internet.)  ASPs
      typically provide their customers with high quality services
      while relieving them from having to operate the computer systems
      themselves.

>Relationship of the Three-Tiered Architecture to DML</H2
><P
>&#13;      When RFPK started in 1998, five deliverables were envisioned:
      SPK, SDPK, SCPK, PCPK and GCPK.  Subsequently, based on feedback
      from potential users and from the Advisory Committee, the five
      items were replaced by two: SPK and DML.  Most of the software
      development efforts up until now have been directed toward SPK.
      DML, however, has remained part of the vision.  The 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Differential Equation Modeling Language (DML)</I
>
      was to be a component of the
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Differential Equation Modeling System (DMS).</I
>
      Together these
      exist today as a language definition and a conceptual design.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      There is a clear parallel between DML/DMS on the one hand and
      the Client and Foundation tiers on the other.  DML was a model
      specification language which was to be automatically translated
      into a driver and linked to the SPK library in a manner
      conceptually similar to the process by which designs coming from
      a MDA will be compiled and linked to the SPK library for running
      on the CSPK.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The difference between these two design approaches is that DML
      is a new language, unused by any scientist at the present time,
      whereas the MDAs will be developed to use existing languages.
      Because reaching users has become a very high priority for RFPK,
      we do not intend to experiment with new languages at this time.
      It is conceivable that at some future date, after MDAs for
      Nonmem, Matlab, and some of the other existing model development
      languages have been completed, a MDA for DML will be considered.
