>&#13;      The Resource for Population Kinetics (RFPK), in addition to its roll
      as an academic research group and the principal developer of 
      the System for Population Kinetics (SPK), operates a
      demonstration installation of the software.  This installation
      runs every day, around the clock, providing  
      service to selected researchers.  It is a test-bed not only for
      the software but also the processes that support a 
      production-quality service.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In the life-cycle of SPK, deployment is the stage which moves
      a minor version of the software into production.  The entire
      process of producing a new minor version is the following:

	    </A

	    The output of the system testing phase is a 
	    <I

	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    A candidate is <I

	    on the most recent candidate and, if the test is successful,
	    moves the new minor version into production.  The purpose of
	    the regression test is to insure that the software continues
	    to run everything correctly that it was able to run before
	    the change; in other words, that the software has 
	    <I

>&#13;      As explained in the <A

      of the regression test is to demonstrate that the software has 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"

      the command

>&#13;	<B
CLASS="command"

HREF="../../ops/utils/regression_test.html"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;	<B
CLASS="command"
>regression_test.pl</B
>
      </A

      A successful test returns zero as the value of the exit status.

>&#13;	The server side of SPK goes into action when the client program,
	known as the MDA, submits a job.  The responsibility of the server
	side is to process the job and to return results to the client.
	A regression test for the server side consists, quite naturally,
	of a set of jobs along with their expected results.  The jobs are
	run and the results compared with what was anticipated.  If 
	there are no significant differences, the test is a success.
	The entire process of extracting the set of selected jobs from the
	database, of running them, and of comparing results is handled
	automatically by regression_test.pl
      </P
><P
>&#13;	The jobs to use are specified for regression_test.pl in a configuration
	file.  Here are some guidelines for selecting jobs:
	<P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Jobs should be good representatives of the sort of jobs that 
	      scientific researchers create, but they should be selected or
	      modified so that they do not take very long to run.  As 
	      new features are added to SPK, the set of jobs in the regression
	      test increases in size, and so does the quantity of resources
	      consumed each time the test is run.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Coverage should be strived for. Every computational 
	      behavior of SPK should be exercised by at least one job.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Jobs which produce errors or fail to converge should be
	      included, to test that error handling capabilities have not
	      regressed.

      engineers develop a sequence of deployment candidates between actual
      deployments of the software to the production environment.  Each
      candidate represents a potential minor version.  Each candidate
      could be one of those that is deployed. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Whenever a software engineer stages a candidate, it is her or his
      responsibility to write a brief set of release-notes describing what
      changes are included in the candidate.  The software engineer does this
      by editing a text file that is created, in skeletal form, by 
      the

><P
>&#13;      When a candidate is deployed, all of the release-notes files accumulated
      since the last deployment are concatenated to form the release-notes for
      the deployed minor version.  This is done automatically by running the
