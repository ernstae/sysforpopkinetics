      <p><span class="bold"><b>Colophon</b></span></p>

      <p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
      experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels.
      Distinctive covers complement our distinctive approach to
      technical topics, breathing personality and life into
      potentially dry subjects.</p>

      <p>The bird on the cover of <i>DocBook: The Definitive
      Guide</i> is a wood duck. Often considered one of the most
      beautiful ducks in North America, the male wood duck has a
      metallic purple and green head with white streaks extending
      from its bill around the eyes and down to its blue and green,
      gold-flecked wings. It has a white neck, chestnut-colored
      chest, a white or red bill, and yellow-orange legs and feet.
      Females have more brown, gray, and subdued hues.</p>

      <p>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book, using a
      19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The
      cover layout was produced by Kathleen Wilson using
      QuarkXPress 3.32 and Adobe's ITC Garamond font. The inside
      layout was designed by Alicia Cech, based on a series design
      by Nancy Priest. The text was formatted from SGML into
      FrameMaker 5.5 with Jade, using a DSSSL conversion stylesheet
      written by Chris Maden. The interior fonts are ITC Garamond
      Light, Garamond Book, and ConstantWillison.</p>

      <p>Whenever possible, our books use RepKover(TM), a durable
      and flexible lay-flat binding. If the page count exceeds
      RepKover's limit, perfect binding is used.</p>

      <p>The illustrations that appear in this book were produced
      by Robert Romano using Macromedia Freehand 8 and Adobe
      Photoshop 5. David Futato was the production editor;
      Madeleine Newell guided the book through the early stages of
      production. Mark Nigara was the copyeditor for DocBook: The
      Definitive Guide. Claire LeBlanc was the production manager.
      Ellie Cutler was the proofreader; quality assurance was
      provided by Jeff Holcomb and Claire LeBlanc. This colophon
      was written by Nicole Arigo.</p>
