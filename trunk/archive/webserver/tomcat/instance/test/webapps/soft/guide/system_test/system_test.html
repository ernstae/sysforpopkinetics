	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    System testing -- also the responsibility of the
	    developer making the changes, but is performed in a
	    special test environment. 
	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>This stage of testing is the subject of this guide.</I
>
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    Regression testing -- responsibility of the 
	    deployment coordinator, who may be a developer or 
	    may be operations staff. This is an
	    automated test in which a set of jobs is run and the
	    results compared with results previously judged to 
	    be acceptable.  In effect, the regression test 
	    insures that the software has <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>not regressed</I
>.
	    Because this test takes considerable time to run and
	    consumes significant computational resources, it is not
	    routinely run as part of a system test.  It must, however,
	    be run before any new or modified software is deployed to
	    the production environment.

    </P
><P
>&#13;      SPK is a complex system, comprising many software
      modules, a number of computers, and several technologies.
      When any software is modified, it must be tested
      thoroughly before being put into production.  To minimize
      the risk that modifications would destabilize the system, it
      is crucial that system-wide testing be performed on exactly the
      same software and hardware infrastructure as is used in production.
      It is for this reason that an SPK installation includes both 
      production and test environments.   Both are identical
      in terms of the following infrastructure components:

    </P
><P
>&#13;      One of the key concepts in the 
      <A
HREF="../../whitepaper/overArch/overArch.html"
TARGET="_top"
>architecture</A
>
      of SPK is that of the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>job</I
>.  With the help of the
      Model Design Agent (MDA), which is the internet client portion of SPK,
      a user creates or imports a model and a dataset, combines them
      as a job, and then submits the job to be processed by the rest of the system. 
      To test the system, it
      is necessary to have jobs which will exercise portions of the system which
      have been added or modified. The principal inputs to the system testing
      process are, therefore, sets of jobs.  These jobs come from two sources:
      <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    The production database, <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>spkdb</I
>.  The utility program
	    <B
CLASS="command"
>take_snapshot.pl</B
> can be used to copy a set of 
	    previously run jobs 
	    from <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>spkdb</I
>, creating files that can be used by
	    another utility, <B
CLASS="command"
>load_spktest.pl</B
> to initialize
	    the test database,
	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>spktest</I
>, with the selected set of jobs along with
	    all related jobs and data.  This is most useful for testing
	    modifications that either fix bugs or enhance existing functions.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    The MDA.  Sometimes new features cannot be tested with existing jobs
	    because those jobs would not have requested the features.  In this
	    case, the tester can use the MDA to create new jobs.
	  </P
></LI
></OL
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Sometimes a test set must be run many times, as the software is debugged.  
      Eventually, all jobs in the set should run as expected.  At that point, the tester
      runs a utility called <B
CLASS="command"
>stage_candidate.pl</B
>, which saves
      all the software in the test environment for subsequent deployment to the
      production environment.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      RFPK recommends a policy of deploying modifications to production on a scheduled
      basis, rather than doing it every time that some software has passed a 
      system test.  Instead, a number of deployment candidates will accumulate
      during the period between scheduled deployments, and it will be the 
      most recent candidate that finally moves into production.  This strategy
      has a number of advantages:
      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    Users learn to expect the behavior of the system to change on 
	    a scheduled basis, rather than randomly. This improves the
	    perception of stability.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    Communication of the changes can occur in an orderly fashion.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    Before deployment, a recursion test should be run to insure that 
	    the modifications do not "break" something that worked previously.
	    Scheduled deployments reduce the frequency with which the recursion
	    test must be executed.
	  </P
></LI
></UL
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The process of deployment is covered in another document, 
      titled <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>SPK System Deployment Guide</I
>.  Some organizations
      may wish to assign the responsibility of deployment to a different 
      group than the one responsible for system testing, based on the
      theory that an "arms-length" relationship between development and 
      operations improves quality.
