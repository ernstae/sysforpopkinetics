<H1> B. Errors Generated by Make </H1>
<!--docid::SEC134::-->
<P>

Here is a list of the more common errors you might see generated by
<CODE>make</CODE>, and some information about what they mean and how to fix
them.
</P><P>

Sometimes <CODE>make</CODE> errors are not fatal, especially in the presence
of a <CODE>-</CODE> prefix on a command script line, or the <CODE>-k</CODE> command
line option.  Errors that are fatal are prefixed with the string
<CODE>***</CODE>.
</P><P>

Error messages are all either prefixed with the name of the program
(usually `<SAMP>make</SAMP>'), or, if the error is found in a makefile, the name
of the file and linenumber containing the problem.
</P><P>

In the table below, these common prefixes are left off.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>`<SAMP>[<VAR>foo</VAR>] Error <VAR>NN</VAR></SAMP>'
<DD><DT>`<SAMP>[<VAR>foo</VAR>] <VAR>signal description</VAR></SAMP>'
<DD>These errors are not really <CODE>make</CODE> errors at all.  They mean that a
program that <CODE>make</CODE> invoked as part of a command script returned a
non-0 error code (`<SAMP>Error <VAR>NN</VAR></SAMP>'), which <CODE>make</CODE> interprets
as failure, or it exited in some other abnormal fashion (with a
signal of some type).  See section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC56">Errors in Commands</A>.
<P>

If no <CODE>***</CODE> is attached to the message, then the subprocess failed
but the rule in the makefile was prefixed with the <CODE>-</CODE> special
character, so <CODE>make</CODE> ignored the error.
</P><P>

<DT>`<SAMP>missing separator.  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD><DT>`<SAMP>missing separator (did you mean TAB instead of 8 spaces?).  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD>This means that <CODE>make</CODE> could not understand much of anything about
the command line it just read.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE> looks for various kinds
of separators (<CODE>:</CODE>, <CODE>=</CODE>, TAB characters, etc.) to help it
decide what kind of commandline it's seeing.  This means it couldn't
find a valid one.
<P>

One of the most common reasons for this message is that you (or perhaps
your oh-so-helpful editor, as is the case with many MS-Windows editors)
have attempted to indent your command scripts with spaces instead of a
TAB character.  In this case, <CODE>make</CODE> will use the second form of
the error above.  Remember that every line in the command script must
begin with a TAB character.  Eight spaces do not count.  See section <A HREF="make_4.html#SEC28">4.2 Rule Syntax</A>.
</P><P>

<DT>`<SAMP>commands commence before first target.  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD><DT>`<SAMP>missing rule before commands.  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD>This means the first thing in the makefile seems to be part of a command
script: it begins with a TAB character and doesn't appear to be a legal
<CODE>make</CODE> command (such as a variable assignment).  Command scripts
must always be associated with a target.
<P>

The second form is generated if the line has a semicolon as the first
non-whitespace character; <CODE>make</CODE> interprets this to mean you left
out the "target: prerequisite" section of a rule.  See section <A HREF="make_4.html#SEC28">4.2 Rule Syntax</A>.
</P><P>

<DT>`<SAMP>No rule to make target `<VAR>xxx</VAR>'.</SAMP>'
<DD><DT>`<SAMP>No rule to make target `<VAR>xxx</VAR>', needed by `<VAR>yyy</VAR>'.</SAMP>'
<DD>This means that <CODE>make</CODE> decided it needed to build a target, but
then couldn't find any instructions in the makefile on how to do that,
either explicit or implicit (including in the default rules database).
<P>

If you want that file to be built, you will need to add a rule to your
makefile describing how that target can be built.  Other possible
sources of this problem are typos in the makefile (if that filename is
wrong) or a corrupted source tree (if that file is not supposed to be
built, but rather only a prerequisite).
</P><P>

<DT>`<SAMP>No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD><DT>`<SAMP>No targets.  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD>The former means that you didn't provide any targets to be built on the
command line, and <CODE>make</CODE> couldn't find any makefiles to read in.
The latter means that some makefile was found, but it didn't contain any
default target and none was given on the command line.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE>
has nothing to do in these situations.
See section <A HREF="make_9.html#SEC96">Arguments to Specify the Makefile</A>.<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>Makefile `<VAR>xxx</VAR>' was not found.</SAMP>'
<DD><DT>`<SAMP>Included makefile `<VAR>xxx</VAR>' was not found.</SAMP>'
<DD>A makefile specified on the command line (first form) or included
(second form) was not found.
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>warning: overriding commands for target `<VAR>xxx</VAR>'</SAMP>'
<DD><DT>`<SAMP>warning: ignoring old commands for target `<VAR>xxx</VAR>'</SAMP>'
<DD>GNU <CODE>make</CODE> allows commands to be specified only once per target
(except for double-colon rules).  If you give commands for a target
which already has been defined to have commands, this warning is issued
and the second set of commands will overwrite the first set.
See section <A HREF="make_4.html#SEC46">Multiple Rules for One Target</A>.
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>Circular <VAR>xxx</VAR> &#60;- <VAR>yyy</VAR> dependency dropped.</SAMP>'
<DD>This means that <CODE>make</CODE> detected a loop in the dependency graph:
after tracing the prerequisite <VAR>yyy</VAR> of target <VAR>xxx</VAR>, and its
prerequisites, etc., one of them depended on <VAR>xxx</VAR> again.
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>Recursive variable `<VAR>xxx</VAR>' references itself (eventually).  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD>This means you've defined a normal (recursive) <CODE>make</CODE> variable
<VAR>xxx</VAR> that, when it's expanded, will refer to itself (<VAR>xxx</VAR>).
This is not allowed; either use simply-expanded variables (<CODE>:=</CODE>) or
use the append operator (<CODE>+=</CODE>).  See section <A HREF="make_6.html#SEC65">How to Use Variables</A>.
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>Unterminated variable reference.  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD>This means you forgot to provide the proper closing parenthesis
or brace in your variable or function reference.
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>insufficient arguments to function `<VAR>xxx</VAR>'.  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD>This means you haven't provided the requisite number of arguments for
this function.  See the documentation of the function for a description
of its arguments.  See section <A HREF="make_8.html#SEC83">Functions for Transforming Text</A>.
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>missing target pattern.  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD><DT>`<SAMP>multiple target patterns.  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD><DT>`<SAMP>target pattern contains no `%'.  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD><DT>`<SAMP>mixed implicit and static pattern rules.  Stop.</SAMP>'
<DD>These are generated for malformed static pattern rules.  The first means
there's no pattern in the target section of the rule; the second means
there are multiple patterns in the target section; the third means
the target doesn't contain a pattern character (<CODE>%</CODE>); and the
fourth means that all three parts of the static pattern rule contain
pattern characters (<CODE>%</CODE>)--only the first two parts should.
See section <A HREF="make_4.html#SEC48">Syntax of Static Pattern Rules</A>.
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.</SAMP>'
<DD>This warning and the next are generated if <CODE>make</CODE> detects error
conditions related to parallel processing on systems where
sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s can communicate (see section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC61">Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>).  This warning is
generated if a recursive invocation of a <CODE>make</CODE> process is forced
to have `<SAMP>-j<VAR>N</VAR></SAMP>' in its argument list (where <VAR>N</VAR> is greater
than one).  This could happen, for example, if you set the <CODE>MAKE</CODE>
environment variable to `<SAMP>make -j2</SAMP>'.  In this case, the
sub-<CODE>make</CODE> doesn't communicate with other <CODE>make</CODE> processes and
will simply pretend it has two jobs of its own.
<P>

<DT>`<SAMP>warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.</SAMP>'
<DD>In order for <CODE>make</CODE> processes to communicate, the parent will pass
information to the child.  Since this could result in problems if the
child process isn't actually a <CODE>make</CODE>, the parent will only do this
if it thinks the child is a <CODE>make</CODE>.  The parent uses the normal
algorithms to determine this (see section <A HREF="make_5.html#SEC59">How the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> Variable Works</A>).  If the makefile is constructed such that the parent
doesn't know the child is a <CODE>make</CODE> process, then the child will
receive only part of the information necessary.  In this case, the child
will generate this warning message and proceed with its build in a
sequential manner.
