----------------------------------
USER VISIBLE CHANGES
C++ source code generated by SPK Compiler now contain
code statements for 
all processes, optimization/simulation/statistics, even

RELEASE NOTES FOR VERSION 0.1.25
----------------------------------
USER VISIBLE CHANGES
A kind of warning message generated when an individual's 
line search algorithm hits the boundaries was being
inserted into a wrong place in the XML file that contains
the computational results.  As a result, the results XML 
was parsed inproperly by MDA and displayed wrong.
This kind of warning message is now handled properly
so that it won't corrupt the result XML document.

OTHER CHANGES
The order in which the minimal representation of Omega and Simga
is stored internally within PopPredModel is changed from
row-major to column-major.  This change is not visible to the MDA users.

The job drivers generated by SPK Compiler have become more generic
so that the code for data simulation is embedded even when it is not
requested by the user and can be executed by flipping a boolean flag
within the job driver.
