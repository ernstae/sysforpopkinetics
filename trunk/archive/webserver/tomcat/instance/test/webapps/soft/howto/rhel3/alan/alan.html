>Purchase RHN Subscriptions</H2
><P
>&#13;      Each Linux machine must have a subscription
      to the RedHat Network (RHN) update service.  It does not matter whether
      the machine is used as a developer workstation or as a server.  
      RFPK uses <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>RedHat Enterprise Linux Academic 
	Server Edition</I
> for all Linux machines.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      When adding a new 
      Linux computer the the set already in use at RFPK, it is much easier
      if the subscription for it is purchased before Linux is installed.
      RedHat has designed its installation process so that the first time
      the system is booted after all the software has been loaded, 
      additional configuration information is requested, including the
      account name for the RHN subscription.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      RedHat provides academic pricing, which costs much less than the 
      standard pricing.  The RedHat

HREF="http://www.redhat.com/solutions/industries/education/products/"

      website is unclear about whether or not computers owned by the university,
      as opposed to those owned by students, faculty or staff, are eligible for
      this favorable pricing.  Ben Freeman, the RedHat sales representative 
      assigned to the educational industry group, affirm, however, that RFPK
      owned machines are eligible.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      To get academic pricing on a new subscription, and to have that subscription
      added to the account that we already have, is a bit tricky. If you 
      carefully do the following, it should work.

>Renew RHN Subscriptions</H2
><P
>&#13;      A month or two in advance of the expiration of an RHN subscription, you will
      receive email from RHN encouraging you to renew.  The message contains a
      link to the renewal web site.  It is best to renew immediately, especially
      if the subscription is for the workstation (WS) edition.  The academic
      price of WS is $25, but it is not offered anymore, except for renewals.
      If you allow the subscription to expire, you will have to purchase an
      academic server (AS) subscription for $50. Even when you renew several
      months in advance of expiration, your credit card will not be charged 
      until the old subscription expires and the new subscription goes into
      effect.

>Using the University of Washington's RedHat Site Licences</H2
><P
>&#13;      The University of Washington now maintains a satellite RedHat Network Server
      on campus, and has purchased a site-license for all University of Washington
      students, faculty and staff.  Configuring your computer to work with the 
      satellite server will enable updates to be performed using the up2date command 
      on either the workstation (WS) or advanced server (AS) editions of RedHat 
      Enterprise Linux versions 3 and 4.  The benefit of using this system is 
      primarily the savings of $25/subscription through RedHat.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      One consequence of using the University of Washingon's RedHat Linux site license
      is that RedHat will no longer provide customer support for your installation of 
      the software, and you are essentially on your own.  This should not be used unless
      you are very familiar with the Linux operating system, or you have a system
      administrator who is able to support your installation.

      Sun V20z, which acts as the cspkserver, has the AMD-64 architecture.  All the
      others have the standard architecture.  This section outlines the process

>Dhcp</H5
><P
>&#13;	    IpCop provides a dhcp server for the green network.  When
	    first added to the network, a host receives its IP address and 
	    certain other network configuration parameters from the dhcp 
	    server.  This simplifies system administration.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    One side-effect of using a dhcp server is that the IP address can
	    change if a host is removed from the network and then later reconnected,
	    because the IP address may be reassigned to a different machine in the meantime.  
	    Processes in place at RFPK expect IP addresses not to change, however.
	    For example, the deployment script, <B
CLASS="command"
>deploy_candidate.pl</B
>,
	    copies files from aspkserver to cspkserver.  If the IP address of 
	    cspkserver were to change, the script would <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"break"</SPAN
>.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    Dhcp has a feature called the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>lease</I
> which keeps
	    an IP address from being reassigned immediately.  A host has a lease
	    on an address for a fixed period of time: 120 minutes, for example.
	    If the lease time is made very long, the IP address becomes, in effect,
	    fixed
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    When a host that is configured to use dhcp is connected to the 
	    network, it needs to discover what IP address to use.  It sends
	    a message to the dhcp server containing a unique code
	    which distinguishes it from every other computer
	    in the universe.  The code that is used is the MAC address of the
	    ethernet card that the host is using for the communication.  The
	    ethernet standard requires every card to have a unique MAC address.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    When the dhcp server receives the MAC address from a host that is 
	    trying to discover its IP address, it first looks in a table to determine
	    whether or not that MAC address already has a lease on an IP.
	    If so, it sends the IP address back to the host; otherwise it creates
	    a new, temporary lease relating the MAC address with an IP address
	    that was currently unassigned.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    The <TT
CLASS="guilabel"
><B
>dhcp</B
></TT
> screen provides a simple
	    means for extending the time period of an existing lease
	    practically to infinity, effectively making it
	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"

	    address and IP address of the lease in the fields
	    provided.

>&#13;	    Always be sure to get an invoice or receipt that indicates what 
	    was bought.  When ordering on-line, print the order page as
	    well as any email confirmation.  When the goods arrive, 
	    look for an invoice in the package  or affixed to it.  As a
	    lasting record, keep the best of the invoices for a given
	    item, if there is more than one, and discard the others.
