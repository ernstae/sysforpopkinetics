><P
>&#13;      The Network Time Protocol (NTP) allows computers connected
      to the Internet to keep their clocks synchronized.  Certain
      host computers equipped with accurate clocks make the NTP
      service available to other, less well endowed, hosts.  
      A machine with an accurate clock which is offering an NTP
      service is known as a <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>level one</I
> NTP
      server.  Other machines, which may not be equipped with
      accurate clocks but which nevertheless have accurate time
      due to the fact that they are synchronized to one or more
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>level one</I
> NTP servers, can offer an
      NTP service over the Internet as <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>level two</I
>
      NTP servers, and so on.

>&#13;      The host

      is a <I
CLASS="emphasis"

> NTP server equipped
      with a clock that gets its time from GPS satellites. 
      The RFPK Linux server,
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>whitechuck</SPAN
>,
      is synchronized to 
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>bigben</SPAN

      and several other <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>level one</I
> NTP servers.
      This document describes the way to configure your 
      RedHat Linux 8.0 workstation to synchronize to 
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>whitechuck</SPAN

    </P

>&#13;      There are two reasons for synchronizing our workstations to
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"

      rather than to 
      <SPAN

	    should go out of sync with the <I

	    servers because of Internet problems, for example, our CVS

>&#13;      In this section, we will edit several configuration files. To do this, 
      you will need root privilege.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      We will start by putting the file
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/ntp.conf</TT
> under local
      source control:
      <TABLE

><TD
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;su -
cd /etc
ci -l /etc/ntp.conf
      </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      With your favorite editor, set the default behavior to 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>nomodify</I
> rather than 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>ignore</I
>, which completely disabled the
      NTP service.
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;restrict default ignore

	<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>should be changed to</I
>

restrict default nomodify
      </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      Next specify that 
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>whitechuck</SPAN
>
      is our trusted time server by making these changes:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;# restrict mytrustedtimeserverip mask 255.255.255.255 nomodify notap noquery
# server mytrustedtimeserverip

	should be changed to

restrict whitechuck mask 255.255.255.255 nomodify notrap noquery
server whitechuck
      </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      Finally set up a dummy time server in case the Internet is down:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;server time.nist.gov

	should be replaced by

server 127.127.1.0
      </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
</P
><P
>&#13;      After making the above changes, use the <B
CLASS="command"
>rcsdiff</B
>
      command to check your work:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;rcsdiff ntp.conf
      </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Finally, we need to make a small change to the 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/ntp/step-tickers</TT
> file,
      which is a list of time servers queried by your system when it boots.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Still as <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>root</SPAN
>,
      place <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/step-tickers</TT
> under
      source control:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;cd /etc/ntp
ci -l step-tickers
      </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      Now we will concatenate the name
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>whitechuck</SPAN
>
      to the list of time servers to consulted at start up:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;echo whitechuck &#62;&#62; step-tickers
      </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE

CLASS="sect1"

CLASS="sect1"

>Daemon Setup</H2
><P
>&#13;      We need to start the ntp daemon, if it is not already running, and
      make sure that it is started automatically whenever the system reboots.
      As <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>root</SPAN
>,
      input the following commands:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;/etc/rc.d/init.d/ntpd restart
chkconfig --level 2345 ntpd on
      </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      You should now check that your ntp daemon is working.
      Issue this command:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;ntpq -p
      </PRE
></TD

      You should see output that looks something like this:
      <TABLE

>&#13;      I believe that this
      shows that there are two time servers, the dummy local server to
      be used in case the network is down, and 
      <SPAN

>whitechuck</SPAN
>.
      It shows that 
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>whitechuck</SPAN

      gets its time from

      is a level 2 server, it is remote, it was last queried 192 seconds ago,
      it is queried every 256 seconds, a measure of its estimated
      "reachability" is 377, there is a delay of 0.684 milli-seconds
      between the
      time it is queried and the time the response arrives, an offset of 
      0.075 milli-seconds was applied in order to synchronize
      the clocks and an 
      estimate of the random error is 0.024 milli-seconds.

>&#13;      If you do not get comparable numbers (for example, the jitter is 0.000)
      there is something wrong.
