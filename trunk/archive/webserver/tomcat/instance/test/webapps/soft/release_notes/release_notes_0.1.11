----------------------------------
USER VISIBLE CHANGES
1. The ID field may appear anywhere in the data record 
(ie. it does not have to be in the first column).

2. When the ID field is missing in an individual's data set,
ID="1" is assigned to all data records.

3. When the ID field is missing in a population data set,
every data record is assigned to a different ID value.
The values of ID are 1, 2, 3..., n where n is the number
of data records.  The first record is assigned to ID="1",
the second record is assigned to ID="2" and so on.
