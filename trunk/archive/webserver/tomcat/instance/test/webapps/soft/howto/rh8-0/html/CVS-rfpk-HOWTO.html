>&#13;	CVS a widely used tool for managing revisions to documents
	is now available to RFPK Team Members.
	CVS is especially
	useful when a number of authors or developers work 
	on the same set of documents, especially when these 
	collaborators are not always located in the same office
	or the same campus.  This tutorial provides background
	on revision control systems in general, and shows how
	to get started with CVS, in particular.
    </P
><P
>&#13;	The original version of CVS presents
	a command-line interface to the user.  Much of this document
	is a description of that interface.  A GUI interface, called
	<I

>cervisia</I
>, is now also available, and
	is covered in the last section of this tutorial.

>&#13;    Brad Bell and Ranjan Dash have started a new project that will
    include text documents as well as computer source code.  To manage
    revisions to their documents, they have decided to use a system
    known as CVS rather than Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, which is 
    currently being used by the Software Team to manage revisions
    to SPK.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    CVS is a free, open source product used to manage revisions
    for many important software projects, including Apache, Mozilla, 
    and Linux.  It is especially useful when multiple authors, 
    geographically dispersed, collaborate on the same documents.  
    As configured at RFPK, CVS can be accessed with excellent 
    security from anywhere that there is an Internet connection.
  </P
><P
>&#13;    CVS is available to anyone in RFPK who has a need to manage 
    revisions to their text documents.  This paper contains 
    information specific to the RFPK installation of CVS.  Complete
    information is available in two manuals, copies of which are
    stored on the RFPK internal website.  These are

>CVS and other Revision Control Systems</H2
><P
>CVS is an example of systems variously referred to as
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>revision control</I
> systems,
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>source control</I
> systems, or
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>version control</I
> systems.
      Widely used revision control systems include SCCS, RCS,
      Microsoft Visual SourceSafe (VSS) and CVS. 
      All of these
      systems were designed to work very much as 
      does SCCS, the senior member of the group, which was developed
      at Bell Labs in the 1970s.  Like SCCS, they all store
      revisions as differences between the revised version and
      the original, rather than as complete copies of each version, using
      the algorithms originally incorporated in SCCS. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;      In one important respect, CVS differs from the
      others.  With all of the other systems, only one user
      is allowed to work on a particular document at
      any one time.  When a user wants to make changes to 
      a text, she must first <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>check it out</I
>,
      which means that the revision control system gives
      her the exclusive right to make changes until she 
      subsequently <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>checks in</I
> her modifications
      and thus relinquishes exclusive control.  If someone else
      has checked out the document that she wants to change,
      she must wait until that person relinquishes it.  If she
      is slow to make her changes, others must wait for
      her.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      CVS, too, was originally designed to incorporate the
      exclusive checkout model.  This strategy was abandoned, however.
      The change came about in response to a new set
      of requirements that arose primarily as a result of the rapid expansion
      of the Internet.  Previously, software 
      development groups had almost always consisted of individuals
      working in the same office or the same building.  In fact,
      the leading software development methodologies required
      this.  When you are in the same office, it is relatively
      easy to negotiate directly with your co-workers about who
      should have exclusive modification access to a particular
      document.  When, conversely, you have people working on
      different continents and in different time-zones and who
      communicate asynchronously via email, it may take days
      to get a co-worker to relinquish control.  Similarly, with 
      frequent travel, it became a necessity for team members
      to continue to work at hotels with unpredictable 
      Internet connectivity, or even on airplanes
      or in airports.  The exclusive checkout model had become
      an impediment to productivity in the new global work place.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The break-through came with the reversal of the checkout 
      model.  When a user checks out a project from CVS, she
      gets a complete working copy on her own machine.  She is
      free to make changes to any of the files in her working
      copy.  If, for example, her working copy is on a laptop,
      she can take her laptop off-line, travel to a conference
      or to her vacation home and continue to work on her project,
      secure in the knowledge that just because her 
      computer is temporarily cut off from the Internet or just
      because she can only devote a small part of the day
      to the project, she is in no way impeding her collaborators.
      When her computer comes back on line, whether by dial-up
      connection, connection at an Internet cafe, or the connection
      at her office, she can quickly have her working copy
      updated with any changes her co-workers have made while
      she was cut off from the network.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      What happens if the user's changes conflict with changes
      that have been committed by her collaborators in the
      mean time?  This,
      of course, is the situation that the exclusive checkout
      model avoids.  With the CVS model, however,
      it really is not a problem.  When the user
      executes the CVS <B
CLASS="command"
>commit</B
> command to incorporate her changes
      in the repository,
      CVS will refuse, informing
      her that there are potential conflicts and that she
      will need to perform an <B
CLASS="command"
>update</B
>.
      The update merges the current copy in the CVS repository
      with her working copy, highlighting the differences.
      She can then edit
      her working copy to resolve any differences.  When
      she once again runs the CVS <B
CLASS="command"
>commit</B
>
      command, her revised conflict-free revision will 
      then be accepted, unless, of course, one of her 
      colleagues has committed additional changes while
      she was resolving the previous ones, in which case
      the resolution process may require another iteration.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Occasionally having to enter into a conflict resolution
      process is
      the price users of CVS pay for the freedom to make revisions
      whenever and wherever they can be made most effectively.
      Especially given the importance of collaboration with 
      partners at other institutions within the academic and
      scientific world, CVS will be a valuable addition to
      RFPK's set of resources.

>Repositories</H2
><P
>&#13;      All of the documents under revision control are stored in a
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>repository</I
> on a server.  CVS permits
      several repositories on a single server.  At present,
      we have defined two.  One repository is for the work
      being done by Ranjan and Brad.  The other is for certain
      documents of the Software Team, including this tutorial.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The repository set up for Ranjan and Brad
      has its root in the directory located at the
      absolute path address
      <TT

      has its root in the directory
      <SPAN

>&#13;	/usr/local/cvs_repos/rfpk/r2
      </SPAN
>
      .
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Within a repository, sets of documents are organized as
      modules.  A module could comprise all  the source code for a 
      computer application, or all the source code for a part
      of the application.  It could be all the documents 
      required for an academic paper, or all the chapters of
      a book. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Within the operating system of the computer,
      the repository is a directory hierarchy.  A module name
      can be associated with any directory in the hierarchy,
      with a single file, or even with a list of files.
      For example, the first module added to the 
      <SPAN
CLASS="systemitem"
>r1</SPAN
> repository
      was the module called <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>muscle</I
>,
      so named because it holds a paper that Ranjan and
      Brad are collaborating on which is about oxygen uptake
      in muscles.

>Environment Variables for Repository Access</H2
><P
>&#13;      At present, the only way to use CVS at RFPK
      is from a Unix of 
      Linux computer, or from the Cygwin environment on a 
      Windows computer.  In either case, the initial setup 
      is the same.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      All access to CVS at RFPK is via
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>ssh</I
>, the secure shell.  When you 
      issue a CVS command from the command line on your
      workstation, the local copy of the <B
CLASS="command"
>cvs</B
> program communicates
      with the server via an encrypted channel that it
      calls upon <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> to provide.  The command is actually 
      executed on the server, with data being piped through the
      encrypted channel between the server and your workstation.
      This is, arguably, the most secure arrangement possible on
      the Internet. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Because <B
CLASS="command"
>cvs</B
> was originally designed to perform remote
      execution using not <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> but rather an insecure program
      called <B
CLASS="command"
>rsh</B
>, it is necessary to indicate
      to <B
CLASS="command"
>cvs</B
> that only <B
CLASS="command"
>ssh</B
> should be used.  This can be accomplished
      by setting and exporting the <TT
CLASS="varname"
>CVS_RSH</TT
> 
      environment variable.  Using the Bash shell, which is 
      standard with Cygwin, most Linux systems and many Unix
      systems, you would input the following commands
      to the command-line interface:
      <TABLE

><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;	CVS_RSH=ssh
	export CVS_RSH
      </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      To avoid having to type these two lines every time you log
      in to a Linux or Unix shell or start the Cygwin shell
      window, you should add them to your
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.bash_profile</TT
> shell
      initialization file.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Since the server supports several CVS repositories, you must 
      tell CVS which repository you are working with.  Although
      all <B
CLASS="command"
>cvs</B
> commands allow you to identify the repository with
      a command-line argument, it is usually more convenient to
      define an environment variable.  The following lines should

>vice versa</I
>.
	It does not show lines present in both

	of lines which differ.  This can be useful in helping
	you to determine exactly where the differences are 
	located within their respective files.  It is also

>&#13;	The <I
CLASS="emphasis"

> GUI is a useful tool,
	especially for those who strongly dislike command-line
	interfaces. It is, however, a wrapper around the 
	command-line version of CVS,
	and it is impossible to understand without some 
	understanding of the way in which that version 
	works and of its output. Nearly all documentation 
	about CVS describes the behavior
	of the command-line interface.

	command.  Within the repository hierarchy, it is often
	convenient to define subdirectories which are themselves
	the root directories of projects as modules.
      </P

	a client machine.  For this to work, however, you must also
	be installed as a user on the server and must be a member
