>&#13;      This document is a specification for the design and
      configuration of the 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>System for Population Kinetics (Spk)</I
>
      to provide a high degree
      of security against intrusion and attack via the Internet.
      As a practical matter, no system is absolutely safe. The
      goal of Spk, however, is to be at least as safe as 
      major electronic commerce and web services sites.  This
      is a reasonable expectation, because Spk and web commerce
      use the same technology.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Spk consists of a number of different processes running
      concurrently.  Each type of process has its own security
      requirements.  This document begins with an analysis
      of these needs.  It then goes on to show how these 
      requirements can be met with a straight-forward and 
      inexpensive configuration of software and hardware.

	    Whenever a user accesses an Spk service, she needs to
	    know that the service is authentic.  She does not 
	    want to entrust her model designs or her data to a
	    site which might be an imposter.

	    An Spk service provider needs assurance that the

	    do so.

CLASS="emphasis"
>Security of Models, Data, Jobs and Results</I
>
	    A user needs to know that his information is secure
	    from tampering, misappropriation and loss.
	    It must be transmitted to and from Spk securely
	    and its security must be assured while it is stored
	    within the system.

>&#13;      A functioning Spk consists of many independent processes
      running concurrently. Some processes or groups of processes
      of the same type require their own computer. Others can
      share a computer with different processes.  In the following
      discussion, when we talk of <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>servers</I
>,
      we do not necessarily mean that these are all hosted on
      separate machines.  A minimal Spk requires only
      two separate computers, in addition to client workstations
      and a gateway/firewall.

>&#13;      The Spk network consists of two subnetworks:
      <P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>LAN (Local Area Network)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)</P
></LI
></OL
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Of the two, the LAN is the more secure.  Hosts on the LAN
      are not reachable from the Internet, because access is 
      blocked by the firewall.  In addition, all of these hosts
      have so-called <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>private</I
> IP addresses,
      which are ignored by the routing and switching equipment
      of the Internet. These private IP addresses render the
      LAN invisible to the public Internet.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Just like the LAN, the hosts in the DMZ are assigned private
      IP addresses.  Although these hosts are invisible to the
      Internet, a few of the services that they provide are not.
      Located in the DMZ are a web server and an ssh server.
      By virtue of an internet feature known as 
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>port forwarding</I
>, the firewall sends any
      requests for web service (http or https) to the web server,
      and any request for ssh connection to the ssh server. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The invisiblity of the individual hosts of the LAN and the DMZ
      shields them from external attack. All hosts connected to
      networks are capable of providing many services which are vulnerable,
      due to faulty software or to misconfiguration.
      In the Spk network, only two services are exposed to the
      public Internet, greatly reducing the chances of error.  
      The two services offered correspond exactly to the set of 
      services essential to the demonstration and ongoing development of Spk.
