>The Problem to be Solved</H3
><P
>&#13;	To better understand and to predict the operation of biological
	systems, researchers design mathematical models which they 
	believe will closely conform to observations.  The
	equations that comprise these models contain parameters whose
	values must be determined by "fitting" the equations to real-world
	data.  In the biomedical field of population kinetics (PK), a methodology
	known as <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>nonlinear mixed-effects modeling</I
>
	has been very successful.  This technique, when properly applied,
	can provide models which
	accurately project the behavior of an entire population from
	a small number of observations collected from a small sample 
	of individuals.  This makes this technology 
	very attractive in medicine and pharmaceutical 
	development, because collecting data from living subjects is a
	difficult, time-consuming, sometimes risky and, inevitably, expensive procedure.

>&#13;	From a computational stand-point, the process of developing
	nonlinear mixed-effects models presents some interesting challenges.
	<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Computing the parameters is highly processor intensive. In 
	      developing a model, it may be necessary
	      to perform the computation many times.  On a 
	      very fast workstation, each recalculation of the
	      model can take a week.  On a typical single processor workstation,
	      only one such calculation can be performed at a time.
	      Clearly, it would be desirable to offload the 
	      calculation to a specialized computational engine.
	      Going even further, it would be highly desirable
	      to distribute the calculation over a cluster of
	      processors, for parallel computation.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Although a high performance cluster is the ideal 
	      platform for model computation, it is unacceptable,
	      by itself, as a platform for model design and
	      results analysis.  Model design is a creative 
	      process, and the user needs appropriate tools to 
	      enhance this process.  The preferred platform
	      to support these tools is the same one the user
	      employs for other creative work, such as 
	      writing papers, preparing presentations, 
	      communicating with colleagues, etc.  In nearly
	      every case, this platform will be a personal computer
	      workstation or laptop running the user's preferred
	      operating system, whether Windows, Macintosh ,or Linux.

></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Internet connectivity is just as important as her
	      workstation or laptop to the creative
	      designer of PK models.
	      While a model's parameters are 
	      being computed, the user will be working on other models
	      or unrelated work, but will need to monitor
	      the progress of her PK jobs as they are processed
	      to completion.  The user should be able, for example,
	      to submit a job
	      for computation at her office, obtain results and
	      resubmit a modified model at an airport en route to a 
	      conference, and receive the completed work upon arrival
	      at her destination.

>SPK is a Web Service</H3
><P
>&#13;	SPK is a service delivered to researchers via the world wide
	web, which enables them to develop, compute and validate PK models quickly and
	efficiently. The service is offered to a designated set of 
	users by an SPK service provider.  At the present time, the
	only SPK service provider is RFPK itself, but in the future,
	many additional service providers,
	located at both academic and commercial research laboratories,
	are envisioned.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Although SPK can run on a single machine, its real power can
	only be realized when a high performance computational cluster
	is involved. Computer resources cost money, hence the SPK
	service will not be free. We believe that competition between
	service providers will, however, insure that pricing will 
	be fair.  In part to encourage the establishment of as many
	SPK installations as possible, SPK software will be distributed 
	free-of-charge under an open source license.

>The User Perspective</H3
><P
>&#13;	The user's access to SPK is provided by two graphical user interface
	(GUI) programs.  One of these is simply the web browser of the user's
	choice, such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla, or Opera. 
	The other is a component of SPK called the Model
	Design Agent (MDA).
      </P
><P
>&#13;	The MDA is written in the Java language, so that
	it works under nearly any operating system, including 
	Windows, Linux and Macintosh.  The first time the user 
	accesses an SPK installation with her browser,
	she is lead through the downloading and installation 
	of the MDA and, if not already present,
	the Java runtime environment.  This only takes a few 
	minutes.  At the beginning of subsequent sessions, she
	does not need to download any software unless updated 
	versions are available, in which case, the download and 
	installation occur automatically.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	The following is an abbreviated list of functions that a 
	user can perform with the assistance of the MDA:
	<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Specify a new model and save it in a central database
	      maintained by the service provider.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Update an existing model to create a new version.
	      The new version does not destroy its predecessor.
	      Instead, all versions are preserved by means of a 
	      revision control system.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Import or create a dataset and save it in the central
	      database.

	      are also maintained by the revision control system.

	      initial estimates of model parameters
	      and some additional information to create a job and

	      subsequent running on the computational engine.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Check the status of all jobs that the user has submitted.
	      At a given moment in time, a job can be

		  </P

	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Provide a simple and convenient presentation of results.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Export results in forms required by other analysis and
	      visualization tools.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Create a new job by cloning a previous job, changing 
	      initial arguments, run parameters, method or dataset.
	      For example,  SPK currently supports several methods of 
	      calculation, including 
	      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>first order </I
>,
	      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>expected Hessian </I
>,
	      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Laplace approximation </I
> and
	      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Monte Carlo likelihood </I
>, 
	      which have been listed in order of increasing computational cost.
	      The user might want to start with a quick 
	      computation using the first order method, then
	      follow with one of the more expensive methods,
	      using as initial estimates the first order results.
	      The MDA makes this very convenient for users.

>The Service Provider Perspective</H3
><P
>&#13;	The MDA, described in the section 
	<A
HREF="#AEN40"
>above</A
>, is the
	<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>client side</I
> of
	SPK.  Everything else is on the 
	<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>server side</I
>, which is provided 
	by an <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>SPK service provider</I
>.
        A service provider might simply be
	a function within an academic department. It might be an operation
	of a a campus-wide department of academic computing. The
	service provider might be part of the IT department of a commercial
	lab or pharmaceutical company.  It might be a service provided
	by a consulting organization to its clients. 
      </P
><P
>&#13;	There are, inevitably, costs involved with providing SPK service.
	In some cases, these costs are simply absorbed in departmental
	budgets or research grants.  In other cases, costs will be billed
	back to users. Commercial operations may want to build a profit into the
	fees that they charge. At present, SPK software does not contain
	any functions that directly support billing. Information that could
	provide the basis for billing or charge-back is, however, present in
	the database.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	SPK does not require any predetermined set of computers.  It
	is, in fact, possible to run the entire system on a single 
	machine.  Other than for demonstration purposes, however,
	using a single machine does not make sense, because this
	brings insufficient computational power to bear. At RFPK,
	the server side consists of two server machines, plus a
	computational cluster.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	In discussing Internet software, one is just as likely to 
	apply the designation of <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>server</I
> to a 
	program as to a machine. For example, the Apache Web Server
	is software, not hardware.  It is common for more than one
	software server to run on a single machine.  It is also common
	for a software server which requires a lot of resources to
	be replicated on multiple machines in order to share the
	load.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	From a software point of view,
	the server side of SPK consists of an
	application server, computational server, a web server and
	a database server. At RFPK, the web server is a separate 
	machine for security reasons, the application and database
	server share a machine, and the computational server runs on a 
	computational cluster.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	All SPK server-side software is developed using the GNU software
	development tools to be portable to any
	Linux or Unix environment.  Unlike the client-side MDA,
	the server side cannot
	be run on Windows and Macintosh systems.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Installing and operating
	the server side is non-trivial.  In the development of SPK,
	a strategic decision was made to move as much of the inherent
	complexity of the system onto the server side as possible, in 
	order to maximize the convenience to the end user.  The server side
	is no more complex, however, than comparable web-based applications,
	and well within the competence of system administrators typically
	found in university departments or commercial research facilities.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        SPK is distributed free-of-charge under an open source license.  
	This distribution strategy reduces the risk to service providers,
	because they can modify or continue the development of SPK 
	independent of RFPK, if necessary.  On the other hand, RFPK 
	eagerly encourages collaborative development by all other 
	interested parties.

>The Software Developer Perspective</H3
><P
>&#13;	RFPK uses the GNU GCC compiler and many related tools to develop
	most of the
	SPK server-side software, and the Standard Edition of Sun Java-2
	for the MDA. The MySQL relational database management system
	is a key component. Programming languages include C, C++,
	Perl, and Java. Source code is managed by the CVS revision control
	system.  All of the computers used in software development at
	RFPK run RedHat Enterprise Linux, version 3.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	One of the reasons for distributing SPK under an open source license
	is to encourage cooperative development of the software.  Any
	organization or individual has access to the source code and

>&#13;	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"

	    This is, of course, a requirement for open source distribution.  
	    Equally important, however, is the access that this policy affords
	    to a wealth of open source components which can be freely incorporated
	    into SPK without the need to expend resources negotiating 
	    commercial licensing and pricing issues.
	  </P

	    It must be  possible to modify

	another at home and a third on the road without ever having to

>Design of the Database</H3
><P
>&#13;	SPK employs the MySQL relational database management system to provide
	the database which is central to its architecture. MySQL is very widely
	used on the world wide web.  It bears an open source license when
	distributed as part of a system such as SPK which is also distributed as
	open source.  Recent versions of MySQL support atomic transactions,
	which is required by the <A
HREF="#AEN143"

	automaton because changes in job state require simultaneous 
	changes to multiple tables.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	As explained <A
HREF="#AEN135"
>above</A
>, the database is
	the central communications path between servers. From the 
	<A
HREF="#AEN40"

	storage for models and data, as well as a complete history of his
	jobs.  From the point of view of the

HREF="#AEN79"
>service provider</A
>, the database maintains
	a history of services and the users to whom they were provided.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	In the diagram that follows, the rectangles represent the most important
	tables in the database, while the lines that connect them represent
	relationships.  The arrow head at one end of a connecting line
	indicates the direction of the relationship.  For instance, the
	fact that the arrow head on the line between job and user points
	toward user implies that the user <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>has</I
> a 
	job, rather than the other way around.  The crow's foot symbol at 
	the other end of the line indicates that a user may have zero or
	more jobs.  If a line has no crow's foot, a row of the table at the
	head of the arrow <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>has</I

	table at the foot of the arrow.

>SPK Compiler</H4
><P
>&#13;	  If it were not for the SPK compiler, users would have to express their
	  models as C++ programs.  The compiler frees them from this very 
	  time consuming and error-prone activity by automatically generating
	  the C++ program from specifications they input into the MDA.  The
	  resulting program can subsequently be compiled by the GNU GCC
	  compiler and linked to several 
	  <A

	  binary program for run on the computational engine. 
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  Users can include Fortran-77 statements in their model specifications.
	  The portion of the SPK compiler that translates Fortran into

	  two classic compiler building tools: the
	  <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Lex</I
> lexical analyzer and the 
	  <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Yacc</I

	  the users initial estimates, runtime parameters, and output
	  specifications.

>&#13;	  A Daemon is a program which runs continuously to provide

	  constantly monitors ASPK resources. When sufficient resources
	  become available to compile another job, the daemon scans the
	  database for jobs with <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>queued to compile</I
>
	  status, and picks the job with highest priority.  If several
	  jobs were queued with the same priority, it picks the one which
	  has been waiting the longest.  In practice, the compiler queue
	  is rarely congested, because the compiler takes only a few seconds to
	  process a job.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  When the daemon selects a job for compilation, it creates a 
	  working directory for the job, copies the
	  <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>xml_source</I
> field from the database to a
	  new file called <TT
CLASS="filename"
>source.xml</TT
> and extracts
	  the latest version of the dataset referenced by the
	  <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>dataset_id</I
> field to
	  create a file called <TT
CLASS="filename"
>data.xml</TT
>.  It
	  then runs the compiler as a child process, passing
	  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>source.xml</TT
> and 
	  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>data.xml</TT
> as arguments.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  Because the daemon is the parent of the compiler, it is 
	  notified when the compiler 
	  terminates for any reason, whether successfully
	  or unsuccessfully. If the compilation
	  was successful, the daemon creates an archive (using the
	  Unix <B
CLASS="command"
>tar</B
> command) of the entire working directory,
	  and stores it in the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>cpp_source</I
> field
	  of the database. It changes the state_code to 
	  <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>q2r</I
> (queued to run).
	  If, on the other hand, the compilation terminated with errors,
	  the daemon places an error message, plus any output that the
	  compiler wrote to a file called 
	  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>software error</TT
>, in the
	  <I
CLASS="emphasis"
