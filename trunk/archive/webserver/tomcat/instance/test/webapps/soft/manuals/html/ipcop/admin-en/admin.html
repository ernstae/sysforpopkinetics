On behalf of our Project Leader, Jack Beglinger, the Documentation staff would
                   like to welcome you to the IPCop Users Administration Document.  We would like to take this
                   opportunity to thank you for trying our firewall and we hope that it will serve your needs. The
                   team would also like to thank the IPCop Linux Community for its continuing presence and the
                   outstanding job it does helping new and experienced users alike.  We would also like to thank
                   the team at SmoothWall for bringing the IPCop Linux Community together.</p><p>Whether you are an existing user moving up the version chain or a new user getting
                   ready for your first install, we hope you will find all you need to get up and running in this manual.
                   If, for some reason, something is not covered here and you feel it should be, then by all means
                   contact us and let us know. We always like to hear from our user base (actually some of us are
                   just kinda lonely sitting on the computer all day and a little note is nice every once in a while)
                   and hope to be able to accommodate their needs as much as possible. Now you can relax
                   and enjoy the Internet without having to worry.</p><p>So, here is a bit of information for those of you that have the time to read this and are
                   waiting for your IPCop Linux box to install.  The initial release of IPCop was an interim release
                   to assist us in finding problems in the IPCop Linux Distribution. We are now on our second full
                   release.  If you do happen to find problems, please check the IPCop FAQ first as we attempt
                   to update the FAQ as soon as we find a problem and can provide solid information on either
                   a work around or a direct fix.</p><p>If your problem is not referenced in the FAQ then you can either join us on IRC
                   (server: irc.openprojects.net channel: #ipcop), contact the IPCop mailing list or send the
                   IPCop Linux Group an email for direct support. Please be advised that you will more than
                   likely receive a faster response and solution by using the first 3 methods listed above. Contacting
                   the IPCop Linux Group directly could have a large delay, depending upon our development
                   schedule.</p><p>You may find further information as well as the newest FAQ, mailing list information

        What is IPCop Linux?
    </h2></div></div><p>
        IPCop Linux is a distribution of Linux thats sole purpose
        is to protect your private or SOHO (Small Office/Home Office)
        system/network.
        The IPCop interface is very user-friendly and task-based.
        IPCop offers the critical functionality of an expensive network
        appliance using stock, or even obsolete, hardware and OpenSource
        Software.
    </p><p>
        IPCop Linux (hereafter referred to as IPCop) is our attempt at a
        secure Linux-based operating system that converts a
        redundant/obsolete PC/workstation/fileserver (basically anything
        with a CPU, some memory, a hard drive and 1 or 2 network cards) into a
        firewall and VPN gateway.
    </p><p>
        We are attempting to offer ALL users (beginner to Guru Linux
        user) the chance to experience the security necessary in
        today's Internet environment.
        This is accomplished by offering you the ability to protect and
        filter all traffic that comes in or goes out of your network and
        the ability to allow extra services by making use of a DMZ
        (explained later in more detail).
        Add to this the fact that this is all done by means of a web
        interface (which means you can administer your firewall from any
        computer in your network) and you have a very powerful package.
        What's more,  it is
        <b>
            100% FREE! AND WILL STAY THAT WAY!
        </b>
        That's right. By developing this under the GNU General
        Public License we are offering IPCop <i>FREE</i> to
        anyone interested.
        You can even download the source code to IPCop.
    </p><p>
        Also, because IPCop is administered through a web based GUI
        (Graphical User Interface) the machine that IPCop is installed on
        does not even need a monitor, keyboard or mouse.
        IPCop supports Internal ISDN cards, most network cards, just
        about any connection type
        (analog modem/ISDN/Cable/ADSL/USB ADSL/Ethernet) and also
        includes a complete logging firewall and IDS (Intrusion Detection
        System), DHCP server, IPSec VPN (Virtual Private Network), web
        proxy and much more.
        IPCop is fast, easy to administer, reliable and often includes
        more features and better performance than many commercial
        packages on the market today.
    </p><p>
        By downloading a single ISO file (approximately 22 MB) you can
        create your own copy of IPCop today and at no cost other than
        the time online to download it and the price of the blank CD.
        By implementing the GNU Linux kernel as the core of IPCop, you
        can rest assured that you are receiving a solid foundation for
        your systems/networks security.

        What is the GNU General Public License?
    </h2></div></div><p>
        The GNU GPL was originally written by Richard Stallman and forms
        the basis of how, and to an extent why, GNU/Linux has in the past,
        and continues to, evolve.
        It gives the author(s) of a specific work the protection
        needed/required to allow them to release the package, with source
        code, without the fear of losing a lot of hard work, while at the
        same time allowing the further development and betterment of the
        package involved.
        Your use and installation of IPCop acknowledges acceptance of the
        GNU GPL license and conditions.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="afford"></a>1.3. 
        How can you afford to just give this away?
    </h2></div></div><p>
        IPCop is an Open Source project and is governed by the
        <a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">
            Open Source Initiative's
        </a>
        rules.
        The code is licensed under the GNU GPL and is available for anyone
        to download and improve.
        That's the way open source projects improve is by having
        volunteers study the source and improve it.
        We feel that the GPL is the best license for us.
        We are dedicated to providing the IPCop firewall under the GPL
        License, now and in the future.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="Buy"></a>1.4. 
        What about those who can't afford to download a file that large
        or who don't have a CD Writer?
        Where can I buy a copy?
    </h2></div></div><p>
        For a limited time only (basically until we cannot afford to do
        this any longer) if you are honestly hampered by such a situation,
        contact the IPCop team, and we will burn a copy of IPCop for you
        and mail it via snail mail.
        We hope to establish facilities in the future to address this in
        a more professional manner.
        However, due to the nature of budding projects, this just is not
        feasible at the moment.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="support"></a>1.5. 
        Well, this all sounds great.
        But what if I have a problem?
        Do you offer support or am I left out in the cold?
    </h2></div></div><p>
        If you do have a problem (which we work hard at ensuring that you
        won't have) you are always welcome to contact anyone on the
        IPCop Users mailing list, in the IPCop IRC channel or contact us
        directly through the IPCop Support email facilities.
        We are a bunch of people that are doing all we can to make sure
        you are safe while on the Net and sometimes we do get a bit
        bogged down.
        So please read ALL documentation as well as the IPCop FAQ before
        contacting us directly.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="business"></a>1.6. 
        I really like the package but can the Company that I work for use
        IPCop without paying for it?
    </h2></div></div><p>
        Of course.
        Why not?
        We have released this under the GNU GPL.
        This means that ANYONE has the right to use this software.
        The only real limit being that no one (companies included) may
        violate the copyright.

        To access the IPCop GUI is as simple as starting your browser and entering the IP address
        (of the green IPCop interface) or hostname of your IPCop server along with a port director of
        either 445 (https/secure) or 81(http/insecure):
        <a href="https://ipcop:445" target="_top">https://ipcop:445</a> or
        <a href="https://192.168.10.1:445" target="_top">https://192.168.10.1:445</a> or
        <a href="http://ipcop:81" target="_top">http://ipcop:81</a> or
        <a href="http://192.168.10.1:81" target="_top">http://192.168.10.1:81</a>.
    </p><p>You should now be looking at the Home Page of your IPCop server's Administration
    GUI. You can immediately start exploring the different options and the information available
    to you through this interface. Below, we have listed the Main Configuration/Administration
    Options available through the GUI. When you have acquainted yourself sufficiently with the
    system, please continue with the next section.</p><p>
        IPCop's Administrative Web pages (or AWs) are available via the menu on
        the left.
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Home: Returns you to this screen.
         </p></li><li><p>Information:
                 Displays detailed information on the status of
                 various portions of your IPCop server. System status,
                 network information, traffic graphs, proxy graphs
                 and a list of connections.</p></li><li><p>Dialup:
            Used for the configuration/administration of your
            modem and dial-up/PPP settings, as well as uploading
            firmware and drivers for ADSL equipment.</p></li><li><p>Services:
            Configuration/Administration of your IPCop
            server's many Services options, such as
            the web proxy, DHCP, port forwarding, external
            aliases etc.</p></li><li><p>VPNs:
            Configuration/Administration of your IPCop server's
            Virtual Private Network settings and options.</p></li><li><p>Logs:
            View all your IPCop server's logs (firewall, IDS,
            etc.)</p></li><li><p>System:
            System configuration and utility functions associated with
            IPCop itself, such as system updates, setting the time,
            setting the language, turning on SSH access and IDS services,
            backing up settings and rebooting or shutting down IPCop.
            </p></li></ul></div><p>If all went well during the configuration of your PPP connection and PPP is the
    connection type being used to connect to the Internet, then you will see 3 buttons on the
    IPCop GUI main page.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>You will not see an active connection until you have finished configuring your
    IPCop server.</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Connect - This will force a connection attempt to
         the Internet. Or, if Dial on Demand is selected in the Dialup Profile, clicking
         Connect will switch IPCop into Dial on Demand mode, allowing clients to attempt to
         connect to the Internet automatically.</p></li><li><p>Disconnect - This will sever the connection to
         the Internet.</p></li><li><p>Refresh - This will refresh the information on the
         main screen.</p></li></ul></div><p>In addition to the above buttons you will see the &#8220;Current Profile&#8221;
    being used to connect to the Internet (Set in the Dialup AW). Below the
    &#8220;Current Profile&#8221; line, you will see your actual connection status. This will
    be one of the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Idle - No connection to the
         Internet and not trying to connect.</p></li><li><p>Dial on Demand waiting - Waiting for
         a client on the local network to attempt to
         connect to the Internet.</p></li><li><p>Dialing - Attempting to
         connect to the Internet.</p></li><li><p>Connected - Currently
         connected to the Internet.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you are currently connected to the Internet you will see a Connection status line in
     the following format:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Connected ( #d #h #m #s)</p></li><li><p>d=Days connected</p></li><li><p>h=Hours connected</p></li><li><p>m=Minutes connected</p></li><li><p>s=Seconds connected</p></li></ul></div><p>
         If you have connected via a modem, the
         <i>initial</i> connection speed and
         protocol is displayed below the Connection time.
     </p><p>At the foot of the page you will see a line similar to the following:
     </p><p>
<tt>
7:07pm up 1 day, 7:21, 0 users, load average: 0.03, 0.01, 0.00
</tt>
     </p><p>
         This line is basically the output of the Linux <b>uptime</b> command and
         displays the current time, the days/hours/minutes that IPCop has been running
         without a reboot, number of users logged in to the IPCop server, and the load
         average on the IPCop server.  Additionally, if there are updates available for IPCop
         that you have not yet installed, you will be informed via this page.</p><p>IPCop has two web users, in addition to the root and setup login users. The
         first is called admin. Authenticating as this user gives access
         to all AWs. The other user, called dial, is able only to use the
         Connect or Disconnect buttons.
         By default, the dial user is disabled; to enable it you must set
         a password for that user. No password is required to view the Home
         AW. All others require the admin password.</p><p>
         Clicking on the Sourceforge.net logo on the left of the screen
         takes you to the IPCop project hosted on Sourceforge. There
         you'll find downloads, source code in CVS, a Bug Tracker and
         Mailing Lists.
     </p><p>
         The IPCop slogan at the foot of every window is also a clickable hyperlink
         to the <a href="http://www.ipcop.org" target="_top">http://www.ipcop.org</a> website where you will find
         news of the latest developments, and lots of other useful resources.

                     IPCop uses the Linux Netfilter or IPTables firewall
                     facility to maintain a stateful firewall.
                     Stateful firewalls keep track of connections to and
                     from all GREEN and ORANGE network IP addresses,
                     based on both the source and destination IP
                     addresses and ports, as well as the state of the
                     connection itself.
                     After a connection is established involving protected
                     machines, only packets consistent with the current
                     state of the connection are allowed through the
                     IPCop firewall.

                     Connection end points are color coded based on their
                     network location.

        Note that you cannot select or modify a profile while
        the IPCop server is online, or waiting to go online in
        &#8220;Dial on Demand&#8221;
        mode. Before using this page, go to the
        Home AW and if the status line
        reports Connected or 
        Dial on Demand waiting then the click on
        the Disconnect button before
        returning to this Window. After setting up or
        selecting Profiles, remember to return to the
        Home AW and click the
        Connect button, if you want your
        IPCop server to go back online.
        </p><p><b>Profiles . </b>
        This section of the Window provides the facilities to
        name and set up new Dialup Profiles (up to a total of
        five), or to rename existing Profiles and change their
        parameters.
        </p><p>
        Select a Profile to be created or modified from the
        drop-down list. Fill in or change the parameters for
        the profile (see below) and click on the
        Save button. To select the
        Profile to be used for future connections, use the
        drop-down list to make your choice and click the
        Select button at the
        bottom of the page. Use the
        Restore button while editing a Profile to
        reinstate the previous Profile settings.
        </p><p><b>Interface . </b>
                    This section of the Window allows you to pick
                    the type of device you are using for the
                    connection. A modem or a variety of DSL devices

            (COM1 - COM4) used mostly for modems and ISDN
            cards, or PPPoE which is used mostly for DSL
            connections.
            </p></li><li><p>Select the appropriate 
            Computer to modem rate. This will
            decide how quickly data is passed to and from your
            connection device. With older computer systems or
            modems, you may find it necessary to use one of
            the lower data rates to establish reliable
            computer/ modem communications.
            </p></li><li><p>Enter the correct Number
             to dial for your Internet connection.
            If connecting through the PPPoE interface then
            chances are you will probably be leaving this
            blank.
            </p></li><li><p>Select whether or not the 
            Modem speaker on. Having the speaker on
            allows you to hear the connection taking place and
            can be a useful diagnostic aid when
            troubleshooting. This option is only likely to be
            useful if you are connecting via an analog modem.
            </p></li><li><p>Select your  Dialing
            mode. Use Tone dialing unless your
            telephone connection only recognizes Pulse
            dialing. Pulse dialing is a lot slower than Tone
            dialing.
            </p></li><li><p>Enter your desired Maximum
            retries. This will decide how often
            IPCop attempts to connect to the Internet after a
            failed connection attempt.
            </p></li><li><p>Enter your Idle
            timeout. This will decide how IPCop handles
            your Internet connection when nothing is actually
            being sent or received via the Internet
            connection. The number you enter here indicates to
            IPCop how long it should wait after any Internet
            activity before it disconnects the modem link. If
            you set this parameter to 0
             then IPCop, once connected, will not
            disconnect from the Internet of its own accord.
            </p></li><li><p>The
            Persistent Connection
            checkbox is used to instruct IPCop to
            maintain the modem connection at all times, even
            in the absence of Internet activity. In this mode
            it will attempt to reconnect the Internet
            connection whenever the link fails for any reason,
            such as a connection time-out at the ISP end of
            the modem link. Use this mode with caution. If you
            have metered connection charges you probably will
            not want to use this feature. However, if you have
            unlimited service time (often called &quot;Flatrate&quot;)
            with your ISP, you may want to use this in order
            to keep the link connected as much as possible.
            Note that in
            Persistent
            mode, IPCop will cease reconnecting
            after more than the number of consecutive failed
            dial attempts set in
            Maximum Retries

            In this event, you have to use
            the
            Dial
            button
            on the
            Home AW.
        </p></li><li><p>Dial on Demand is
            available by clicking the checkbox. Note that
            after enabling Dial on Demand, you still have to
            click the Connect button on the 
            Home AW before IPCop will start
            connecting automatically when it detects Internet
            activity. The Dial on Demand
             option is not available for PPPoE
            connections.
            </p></li><li><p>The Dial on
            Demand for DNS option determines
            whether IPCop will connect automatically when it
            detects DNS requests. This will be usually what
            you will want to happen.
            </p></li><li><p>Connect on IPCop Restart
             will make IPCop connect after booting,
            if Dial on Demand
            is not selected. You will probably want to set
            this option as active if you are also using
            Dial on Demand.
            This is because the combination of settings will
            automatically put the IPCop system into Dial on
            Demand waiting mode each time the IPCop server is
            switched on or rebooted.
            </p></li><li><p>ISP Requires Carriage Return
             Some ISPs require that the modem
            sends a carriage return to signal to indicate that
            it is finished sending data. If your ISP requires
            this, then leave it checked. If not then you can
            uncheck this box. The default is checked.
            </p></li></ol></div><p>
        Additional PPPoE settings - If
        either PPPoE  or USB ADSL is enabled, additional
        configuration options are available. Here you can
        enter two additional parameters, a service name, and a
        concentrator name, which some ISPs require. If your
        ISP does not require them, or does not give you any,
        then you may leave these two fields blank. Your ISP
        will give you two settings, VPI and VCI, which you
        must enter if you are using a USB ADSL connection.
        </p><p><b>Authentication. </b>Username and 
        Password are the username and password that
        your ISP should have supplied to you when you opened
        your account with them. There are several ways in
        which ISPs use this username and password to login to
        their systems. The most common methods are PAP or
        CHAP. Select this if your ISP uses either of those
        two. If your ISP uses a text-based login script,
        choose standard login script. For people in the UK who
        use Demon Internet as their ISP, a special script has
        been created for them to use. The &quot;Other&quot; login script
        option has been provided for people who have ISPs with
        special needs. If you need to do this, you will need
        to login to the IPCop box and create a file in
        /etc/ppp. This filename (without the /etc/ppp
        component) should be entered into the Script name box.
        The file contains 'expect send' pairs, separated by a
        tab.
        <i><tt>USERNAME</tt></i> will
        be substituted for the username and
        <i><tt>PASSWORD</tt></i> for the
        password. Examine
        the file demonloginscript in /etc/ppp, and use it as
        an example of what should be in this file.
        </p><p><b>DNS. </b>
        Select Automatic
        if your ISP supports
        automatic DNS server configuration, as is now usually
        the case. The alternative is to leave
        Automatic unticked and put IP
        addresses in the Primary DNS
         and Secondary DNS
         boxes. These IP addresses will generally
        be provided where necessary by your ISP.

        The only section in this area that may not be blank is
        the Connect Timeout. This tells IPCop the amount of
        time to allow the modem to attempt to connect. After
        this number of seconds has elapsed without proper
        response on the receiving end, IPCop will give up and
        move on to the next connection attempt. The default
        should work fine for you but if you notice that the
        connection is being dropped in the middle of the
        negotiation sequence (turn on the modem speaker and
        listen to the attempted connection) then you may need
        to increase this parameter slightly until it connects
        successfully.

                    Transparent box.
                    A transparent proxy means that the internal machines
                    do not have to set their browsers
                    up as if there was a proxy, even though there is.
                    This will automatically redirect requests to
                    cached pages, if they exist.
                    If you are not using transparent proxying, then you
                    should configure your browser to use
                    port 800 on the IPCop as the web proxy.
                    Cache size is the total amount of hard drive space

                        Quick Introduction to DHCP
                    </h4></div></div><p>
                        DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is
                        a way for network administrators to help their
                        users configure their PCs automatically.
                        In addition, it can help shield users from having
                        to change network parameters when they
                        change.
                    </p><p>
                        Without DHCP, when you add a computer to your
                        network, you will have to configure several
                        parameters, IP address, netmask, default router
                        and Domain Name Server address(es).
                        If you are running a Windows network you may want
                        to add your WINS server's IP address.
                        Finally, you may wish to define a
                        &#8220;Domain Name Suffix&#8221;.
                    </p><p>
                        If you are currently connecting to the Internet,
                        without using a firewall, your ISP's
                        DHCP server may be providing these services for
                        you.
                    </p><p>
                        Another feature of DHCP, is it allows properly
                        configured
                        &#8220;foreign&#8221;
                        computers to be hooked up to your
                        local network and start using the Internet
                        immediately.
                        Let's say that your daughter comes home from
                        college on vacation with her laptop.
                        Most colleges force their users to use DHCP.
                        With IPCop's DHCP configured
                        just plugging her laptop into your network
                        will correctly configure the computer.
                        Without DHCP, someone will have to reconfigure
                        the laptop for use on your network, and then
                        remember to reconfigure the machine back to using
                        DHCP when she leaves.
                    </p><p>
                        DHCP works by handing out &#8220;leases&#8221;
                        on IP addresses.
                        That way if a friend from out of town plugs his
                        computer into your network a dynamic address will
                        be assigned.
                        When he goes back home, the address will be recovered
                        and can be used by another computer.
                    </p><p>
                        What if you have some machines that are used as
                        internal servers on your network?
                        They need a fixed IP address, so you can always
                        find them.
                        The DHCP AW will allow you to specify machines that
                        will always get the same IP address.

                        Sets the starting address of your DHCP IP address
                        range from which you wish the DHCP server to supply
                        dynamic IP addresses.
                        This address range should not contain the IPs of
                        other machines on your LAN with static IP assignments.
                        Suppose you had a network in the 192.168.0.0 range.
                        Assuming all your statically assigned IP address were
                        all lower then 192.168.0.100, you could use the upper
                        portion of the address range for the dynamic addresses.
                        In this case your Start Address would be
                        192.168.0.100.

                        Sets the ending address of your DHCP IP address
                        range from which you wish the DHCP server to supply
                        dynamic addresses.
                        As mentioned above, this address range should not
                        contain the IPs of other machines on your LAN with
                        static IP assignments.
                        Using the example above the End Address would be
                        192.168.0.254.

                        Specifies what the DHCP server should tell its
                        clients to use for their Primary DNS server.
                        Because IPCop runs a DNS proxy, you will probably
                        want to leave the default alone and set the Primary
                        DNS server to the IPCop box's IP address.
                        This will shield your machines if your ISP changes
                        its DNS server address.

                        If you run a local DNS server and want your
                        desktops to use it, set the Secondary DNS to its

                        This can be left at its default value unless you
                        need to specify your own value.
                        The default lease time is the time interval IP
                        address leases are good for.
                        Before the lease time for an address expires your
                        computers will request a renewal of their lease,
                        specifying their current IP address.
                        If DHCP parameters have been changed, when a lease
                        renewal request is made the changes will be
                        propagated.
                        Generally, leases are renewed by the server.

                        need to specify your own value.
                        The maximum lease time is the time interval during
                        which the DHCP server will always honor client
                        renewal requests for their current IP addresses.
                        After the maximum lease time, client IP addresses
                        may be changed by the server.
                        If the dynamic IP address range has changed, the
                        server will hand out an IP address in the new
                        dynamic range.

                        Sets the domain name that the DHCP server will pass
                        to the clients.
                        If any host name cannot be resolved, the client will
                        try again after appending the specified name to
                        the original host name.
                        Many ISP's DHCP servers set the default
                        domain name
                        to their network and tell customers to get to the
                        web by entering &#8220;www&#8221; as the default
                        home page on their browser.
                        &#8220;www&#8221; is not a fully qualified domain
                        name.
                        But the software in your computer will append the
                        domain name suffix supplied by the ISP's
                        DHCP server to it, creating a FQDN for the web
                        server.
                        If you do not want your users to have to unlearn
                        addresses like www, set the Domain name suffix
                        identically to your ISP's DHCP server specifies.

                        The DHCP server will pass this address to all hosts

                            However, sometimes, this is too strict a situation.
                            For example, if one is running a web server, then

                            This is not the normal situation for web servers.

                            access to the internal LANs from outside.
                            When you set up your server, you can choose the
                            receiving  or &#8220;listening&#8221; ports on the
                            internal network machines.
                            This is done differently depending on which software
                            is being used.
                            Please refer to the documentation that came with
                            your servers to set up the ports on those servers.
                        </p><p>
                            Once those receiving ports are ready, you are ready
                            to enter information into the AW on IPCop.
                            The TCP/UDP drop down list
                            allows you to choose which protocol this rule will
                            follow.
                            Most regular servers use TCP.
                            Some game servers and chat servers use UDP.
                            If the protocol is not specified in the server
                            documentation, then it is usually TCP.
                            Source port is the port to which
                            the outsiders will connect.
                            In most cases, this will be the standard port for the
                            service which is being offered (80 for web servers,
                            20 for FTP servers, 53 for mail servers, etc.)
                            If you wish, you may specify a range of ports to
                            forward.
                            To specify a range use the &#8220;:&#8221; character
                            between two port numbers, lowest number first.
                            Destination IP is the internal
                            IP address of the server (for example, you may have
                            your web server on 192.168.0.3).
                            Destination Port is the port that
                            you chose when you set up your server in the first
                            paragraph.
                            The SourceIP dropdown menu
                            allows you to choose which Red IP this rule will
                            affect.
                            IPCop has the capability of handling more than one
                            Red IP.
                            If you only have one Red IP set up, then choose
                            Default IP.

                        Port Forwarding and External Access in v1.3.0
                    </h4></div></div><p>
                            The Port Forwarding interface was re-written for version 1.3.0.
                            It is quite different from earlier versions. However, please
                            note that the port numbers used for a particular service have
                            not changed, and you should still refer to these above.
                        </p><p>
                            First off, and most importantly, the External Access page
                            <b>NO LONGER</b>
                            has
                            <b>ANY</b>
                            affect on the GREEN or ORANGE networks. It is there to allow
                            you to open ports to the IPCop box itself and not the GREEN
                            or ORANGE networks.
                        </p><p>
                            How do you open up external access then? It is combined into
                            the Port Forward page - there is a field on the page labelled:
                        </p><p>
                            'Source IP, or network (blank for &quot;ALL&quot;):'
                        </p><p>
                            This is the field that controls external access - if you leave
                            it BLANK, your port forward will be open to
                            <b>ALL INTERNET ADDRESSES</b>.
                            Alternatively if you put an address or network in there, it will
                            be restricted to that network or internet address.
                        </p><p>
                            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/portfwd.png" align="center"></div></div><p>
                        </p><p>
                            You can have more than one external address - after you have
                            created the port forward entry, it will appear in the table.
                            If you wish to add another external address, click the Green
                            Cross next to the entry, the entry screen at the top of the
                            page will change (it will load values from the port forward)
                            and allow you to enter an external IP address or network.
                        </p><p>
                            When added you will now notice that there is a new entry under
                            the port forward in the table.
                        </p><p>
                            Other things to note:

                                    You can have port ranges and wildcards. Valid wildcards
                                    are:
                                </p></li><li><p>
                                    * which translates to 1-65535

                            Valid characters to separate a port range are
                            &#8220;:&#8221; or
                            &#8220;-&#8221;.
                            Note that - will be modified to : even though it will be
                            displayed as a - on the screen.
                        </p><p>
                            You only need to enter the first source port, the destination
                            will be filled in for you.
                        </p><p>
                            You can edit a record by clicking on the Pencil icon in the
                            Action column, and until you hit the update button,
                            nothing changes and nothing is lost.
                        </p><p>
                            When you are editing a record, you will see the record
                            highlighted in yellow.

                            the right hand side of the Action column.
                        </p><p>
                            Ports ranges cannot overlap each other.
                        </p><p>
                            Individual ports cannot be placed in the middle of a range i.e.
                            if you have 2000-3000 already set up and then try to forward
                            port 2500, it will give you an error. You cannot forward the
                            same port to several machines.
                        </p><p>
                            Reserved ports - on the main Red Address (DEFAULT IP) some
                            ports are reserved for IPCop to do its business, they are 67,
                            68, 81, 222, and 445.
                        </p><p>
                            When you edit a port forward, there will be an extra check
                            box labelled 'Override external access to ALL'. This is used
                            as a quick and dirty way to open a port to ALL internet
                            addresses for testing or whatever your reasons. This was a
                            user request.
                        </p><p>
                            If you have a port forward with multiple external accesses,
                            when you delete all of the external accesses, the port
                            becomes open to ALL addresses, be careful of this one.

                            access - click on the &#8220;Enabled&#8221; icon (the green
                            checkmark in the Action column) for the particular entry you
                            want to enable or disable.
                            The icon changes to a small red cross when a rule is
                            disabled. Click on the red cross to enable it again.
                            <b>Note:</b> when you disable
                            the port forward, all associated external accesses are disabled,
                            and when you enable the port forward, all associated external
                            accesses are enabled.
                        </p><p>
                            One other <b>VERY IMPORTANT NOTE</b>.
                            The translation process from 1.2 to 1.3 was not 100% and some
                            entries will be restricted to 127.0.0.1/32 - watch for this if
                            you are upgrading.

                    In some cases, your ISP may assign you a range of IP
                    addresses for your network.
                </p><p>
                    If you have multiple IP addresses, only, so that you can
                    connect multiple, non-server computers, to the Internet,
                    you will no longer need the extra addresses.
                    IPCop should connect directly to your modem or the
                    Internet.
                </p><p>
                    On the other hand, if you are providing a server on one of
                    internal computers you may need to use multiple aliases
                    on your RED interface.
                    To use this facility effectively, you may have to adjust
                    IPCop's routing tables by hand.

                External Access changed in version 1.3.0 so that it now
                only controls access to the IPCop box. It no longer has
                any affect on the Green or Orange network access. That is
                now controlled in the Port Forwarding section, see above.
            </p><p>
                If you wish to maintain your IPCop machine remotely, you
                should specify TCP ports 81, http, and/or 445, https.
                If you have enabled ssh access, you can also enable TCP
                port 222, ssh.

                The TCP/UDP drop down list allows
                you to choose which protocol this rule will follow.
                Most regular servers use TCP.
                If the protocol is not specified in the server
                documentation, then it is usually TCP.
                Source IP is the IP address of an
                external machine you give permission to access your
                firewall.
                You may leave this blank, which allows any IP address to
                connect.
                Although dangerous, this is useful if you want to
                maintain your machine from anywhere in the world.
                However, if you can limit the IP addresses for remote
                maintenance, the IP addresses of those machines or networks
                that are allowed access, should be listed in this box.
                Destination Port is the external
                port that they are allowed to access, i.e. 445.
                The Destination IP dropdown menu allows
                you to choose which Red IP this rule will affect.
                IPCop has the capability of handling more than one Red IP.
                If you only have one Red IP set up, then choose
                Default IP.

                Enabled box and press
                Add.
                This will move the rule to the next section, and list it
                as an active rule.

                interchange point between the external Red Zone and the
                internal Green zone.
                The Green zone has all your internal machines.
                The Red zone is the Internet at large.
                The DMZ allows them to share servers without allowing
                undue access to the internal LAN by those in the Red Zone.
            </p><p>
                For example, suppose that your business has a web server.
                Certainly, you want your customers (those in the Red zone)
                to be able to access it.
                But suppose you also want your web server to be able to
                send customer orders to employees in the Green Zone?
                In a traditional firewall setup, this wouldn't work,
                because the request for access to the Green zone would be
                initiating from outside the Green zone.
                You certainly do not want to give all your customers
                direct access to the machines on the Green side, so how
                can this work?
                By using the DMZ and DMZ pinholes.
            </p><p>
                DMZ pinholes give machines in the Orange (DMZ) zone
                limited access to certain ports on Green machines.
                Because servers (the machines in the Orange zone) have to
                have relaxed rules with respect to the Red zone, they are
                more susceptible to hacking attacks.
                By only allowing limited access from Orange to Green,
                this will help to prevent unauthorized access to
                restricted areas should your server be compromised.
            </p><p>
                The TCP/UDP drop down list allows you to choose which protocol this
                rule will follow.  Most regular servers use TCP.  Some game servers and chat servers use UDP.
                If the protocol is not specified in the server documentation, then it is usually TCP.
                Use the protocol specified on the

                Source IP (labelled in orange) is the
                IP address of the machines in the Orange zone that you
                wish to give permission to access your internal servers.
                The Destination IP is the machine in
                the Green zone that will receive the request.
                Destination Port is the port on the
                Green machine that will be listening for the request.

                For the lucky few, their ISP issues them a static IP
                number.
                This is very handy for setting up servers and for
                inserting one's domain name into Domain Name Servers
                (DNS), but for those whose ISP issues a dynamic IP number
                upon connection (this is done mainly with modem
                connections), then having one's domain name listed in a
                DNS won't work properly.
                For these people, Dynamic Domain Name Servers (DYNDNS)
                were created.
            </p><p>
                DYNDNS services work by issuing a domain name to the user,
                and then having the user update the current IP address
                each time it changes.
                This allows them to have a subdomain name pointing to
                their computer so that they can run services like a web
                server, VNC, etc.
                Because the IP changes each time the user reconnects,
                keeping the DYNDNS service updated used to be a tedious
                chore, but IPCop has simplified that.
                By entering the information on the DYNDNS AW, the DYNDNS
                will be updated whenever your IP changes.
                There is also an option to force an update manually.
                Let's get started.
            </p><p>
                Add a Host: The first step is to
                register with one of the many DYNDNS services available
                on the Internet.
                Several have been listed in the
                Service
                dropdown menu.
                Go to one of those sites, and get a username, password,
                and most importantly, a dynamic domain name.
                Choose the host from the Service
                dropdown menu.
                The Behind a proxy this check
                box has to be checked if you're using the no-ip.com
                service and if your IPCop is behind a proxy.
                This checkbox is useless with other services.
                Enable Wildcards will allow
                you to have all the subdomains of your dynamic DNS
                hostname pointing to the same IP as your hostname
                (e.g. with this check box enabled, www.ipcop.dyndns.org
                will point to the same IP as ipcop.dyndns.org).
                This check box is useless with no-ip.com service, as they
                only allow this to be activated or deactivated directly
                on their website.
            </p><p>
                Hostname and
                Domain refer to the hostname
                and domain you registered with the dynamic service
                provider.
                Using the example above, ipcop is the hostname and
                dyndns.org is the Domain.
                Username and
                Password are the login
                information you chose when you subscribed to one of the
                dynamic DNS service providers.
                Once you have entered all the information, click
                Add to save the information.
                It will now appear in the Current hosts section.
                If you wish to edit the information, check the
                Mark box next to the entry to
                wish to change and then press Edit.
                Once you have made your changes, you will need to resave
                by pressing the Save button.
                There may be times when you want to retain the
                information for one of your dynamic DNS hostnames saved
                but do not want to have it active.
                To do this, uncheck the Enabled
                box and again Save.
            </p><p>
                You can force IPCop to refresh the information manually
                by pressing Force Update, however,
                it is best to only update when the IP address has actually
                changed, as dynamic DNS service providers don't like to
                handle updates that make no changes.
                Once the hostnames have been enabled and updated the
                first time, your IP will automatically be updated each
                time your IP changes, allowing you to always be able to
                find your IPCop and your LAN.

            To create a VPN connection between an IPCop server
            and another IPSec VPN, such as another IPCop server,
            certain important information must be provided.
            The information provided
            <b>
                must match exactly
            </b>
            on both ends (both IPCop servers) before a valid VPN
            connection can be established.
        </p><p>
            By using the Import button near the bottom of this
            section it is easier to make sure the information needed
            is entered correctly.
            The Export button will generate a file with the needed
            VPN Connection information that the VPN Connection Import
            function uses on the second IPCop server.
        </p><p>
            A full and in-depth explanation of the use and
            administration of IPCop VPNs and VPNs in general are

            The information provided below is designed to simply
            explain what each field is for.

        </p><p>
            The first thing to keep in mind is that the Right and Left
            sides of a connection have no intrinsic meaning.
            IPSec determines which side it is running on by checking
            the IP address of the machine it is on and uses this
            information to compare to the IP address of the current
            machine.
        </p><p>
            The information needed to create a new VPN connection is
            as follows:
        </p><p><b>Name. </b>
                A simple name (lowercase only) to identify this
                connection.
            </p><p><b>Left. </b>
                The IP address or fully qualified domain name of
                the Left hand VPN connection.
                This must be different from the Right parameter.
            </p><p><b>Left next hop. </b>
                The next hop from the Left side to the Internet.
                This can be <i><tt>%defaultroute</tt></i>, which means
                that IPCop should use the default route specified by
                your ISP to reach the other side of the connection.
            </p><p><b>Left subnet. </b>
                The network of the Left hand side (ex. 192.168.10.0/24)
                This must be different from the Right subnet, below.
            </p><p><b>Right. </b>
                The IP address or fully qualified domain name of the Right
                hand VPN connection.
                This must be different from the Left parameter.
            </p><p><b>Right next hop. </b>
                The next hop from the Right side to the Internet.

                This must be different from the Left subnet, above.
            </p><p><b>Secret. </b>
                The Password needed to validate the VPN connection.
            </p><p><b>Compression. </b>
                If checked, packets sent on this VPN connection will be

            The Logs AW Consists of four sub-pages -
            other,
            web proxy,
            firewall and
            intrusion detection system.
            These share a common set of interface features to
            select the log information to be displayed, and to
            export that information to your local machine.
            Dropdown Month: and
            Day: lists in the
             Settings:
            area  of the AW for are provided to allow
            you to select Logs information for preceding days and
            months. Each time that you select a new combination of
            Month: and
            Day:,
            you must also click on the
            Update
            button before the Logs information
            will be updated. When you first select a sub-page, the
            Logs information displayed will be that for the
            current date.
        </p><p>
            The buttons marked &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;
            and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; allow you to
            quickly step one day backwards or forwards through
            the logs.
        </p><p>The Logs information appears as a list in the
        main section of the window (usually labelled
        Log:).
        If that list is too long to fit into
        a reasonably sized window, only the latest Logs
        information is displayed. In that situation, the
        Older and
        Newer
        links at the bottom of this section of the
        window become active and you may use these to page
        through the list of Logs data.</p><p>Pressing the Export
        button downloads a text-format file
        (<tt>log.dat</tt>), containing the
        information from the current Logs AW page, from the
        IPCop server to your computer. Depending on how your
        computer is set up, pressing the
        Export
        button will initiate a file download
        dialogue on your computer, show the contents of
        <tt>log.dat </tt> in your web browser
        window, or open the file in a text editor. In the
        latter cases, you can save
        <tt>log.dat</tt> as a text-format
        file if required. </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="logs-other"></a>2.6.2. Other:</h3></div></div><p> This page allows you to view the system and

                record of users who have logged in to, and out
                of the IPCop server. This includes both local
                log-ins and logins over a network via the SSH
                interface.
                </p></li><li><p>

            The SSH subsection of this AW allows you
            to decide if remote SSH access is available on your IPCop
            server or not.
            By placing a checkmark in the box you will activate remote
            SSH access.
            This option is disabled by default and we would advise
            enabling it
            <b>

            Similar to the HTTP and HTTPS ports for the IPCop machine being
            switched to ports 81 and 445, the SSH port on the IPCop machine
            is switched to 222.
            If you are using a GUI based application to access your IPCop machine,
            remember to specify port 222.
            If you are using the ssh, scp or sftp commands, the syntax for specifying
            non-standard ports is different for each command, even though they
            are related.
            Assuming your IPCop machine is at IP address 192.168.254.1, the
            commands would be:

            You can also select the language to be used by IPCop during

            However, your desired language may not be available during
            installation.
            The IPCop translation group is planning on making more
            languages available as volunteers aid the translation effort.
            When new languages become available, you will be able to
            download a new language and if desired, activate it from this
            AW.
        </p><p>
            Of course, you may wish to translate IPCop to another
            language yourself.
            If you do, we urge you to contact the IPCop Translation
            Coordinator, Rebecca Ward, <tt>&lt;<a href="mailto:rebeccaward@cox.net">rebeccaward@cox.net</a>&gt;</tt>,

            The Backup AW will let you back up your IPCop configuration
            to a floppy disk.
            The easiest way to restore your configuration is to reinstall
            IPCop from CD-ROM or HTTP/FTP.
            Early in the installation process, you will be asked if you
            have a floppy with an IPCop system configuration on it.
            If you wish to restore your configuration from a backup floppy,
            place the floppy disk in the floppy drive and select the
            Restore button.
            Your configuration will be restored and installation will
            terminate.
        </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
                At this time, IPCop will not overwrite DOS formatted
                floppy disks.
                To format a floppy disk for IPCop, you will need to
                format it for Linux.
                The command to do this is:
            </p><pre class="screen">
<tt>#</tt> <b><tt>fdformat /dev/fd0</tt></b>
</pre><p>
                If you have another Linux machine, you can format a
                floppy on that machine.
                Otherwise, use ssh or putty to log in to
                IPCop as root, and issue the command there.
                <b>fdformat</b> will not prompt for a floppy
                like DOS format will, so insert the floppy disk into the
                floppy disk drive before issuing <b>fdformat</b>.

            freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
            redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
            commercially or noncommercially.
            Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and

        </p><p>
            This License is a kind of &#8220;copyleft&#8221;, which means
            that derivative works of the document must themselves be free
            in the same sense.
            It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
            copyleft license designed for free software.
        </p><p>
            We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
            for free software, because free software needs free
            documentation: a free program should come with manuals

            We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose

            This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
            that contains a
            notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
            under the terms of this License.
            Such a notice grants a
            world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
            work under the conditions stated herein.
            The
            &#8220;Document&#8221;, below, refers to any such manual or work.
            Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as

            A &#8220;Modified Version&#8221; of the Document means any work
            containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim,
            or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
        </p><p>
            A &#8220;Secondary Section&#8221; is a named appendix or a
            front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with
            the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to
            the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and
            contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
            subject.
            (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
            a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
            The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
            the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
            philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.
        </p><p>
            The &#8220;Invariant Sections&#8221; are certain Secondary
            Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant
            Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released
            under this License.
            If a
            section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
            allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
            Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
            Sections then there are none.
        </p><p>
            The &#8220;Cover Texts&#8221; are certain short passages of
            text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in
            the notice that says that the Document is released under this
            License.
            A Front-Cover Text may
            be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
        </p><p>
            A &#8220;Transparent&#8221; copy of the Document means a
            machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
            is available to the general public,
            that is suitable for revising the document
            straightforwardly with generic text editors
            or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
            drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
            suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation
            to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.
            A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
            markup, or absence of markup,
            has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
            by readers is not Transparent.
            An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
            of text.
            A copy that is not &#8220;Transparent&#8221; is called
            &#8220;Opaque&#8221;.
        </p><p>
            Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
            plain ASCII without markup,
            Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
            publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF
            designed for human modification.
            Examples of
            transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
            Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
            can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
            or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
            generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
            produced by
            some word processors for output purposes only.
        </p><p>
            The &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means, for a printed book, the
            title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
            hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in
            the title page.
            For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
            &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means the text near the most prominent
            appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning
            of the body of the text.
        </p><p>
            A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose
            title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
            text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
            specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
            &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.)  To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot;
            of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
            section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

            You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
            either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
            License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying
            this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all
            copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to
            those of this License.
            You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
            reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
            However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
            If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also
            follow the conditions in
            <a href="#quantity" title="A.4. 3. Copying In Quantity">section 3</a>.
        </p><p>
            You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
            above, and you may publicly display copies.

            If you publish printed copies
            (or copies in media that commonly have
            printed covers)
            of the Document, numbering more
            than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover
            Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry,
            clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts
            on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.
            Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
            publisher of these copies.
            The front cover must present the full title with all words of
            the title equally prominent and visible.
            You may add other material on the covers in addition.
            Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
            preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
            conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
        </p><p>
            If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
            fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as
            fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest
            onto adjacent pages.
        </p><p>
            If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
            numbering more than 100, you must either include a
            machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,
            or state in or with each Opaque copy a
            computer-network location
            from which the general
            network-using public has access to download
            using public-standard network protocols
            a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
            If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
            prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
            quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain
            thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year
            after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
            through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
            public.
        </p><p>
            It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
            authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
            number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
            updated version of the Document.
