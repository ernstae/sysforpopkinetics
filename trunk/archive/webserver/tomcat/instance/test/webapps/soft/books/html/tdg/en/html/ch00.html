      <p>DocBook provides a system for writing structured documents
      using SGML or XML. It is particularly well-suited to books
      and papers about computer hardware and software, though it is
      by no means limited to them. DocBook is a document type
      definition (DTD). Because it is a large and robust DTD, and
      because its main structures correspond to the general notion
      of what constitutes a book, DocBook has been adopted by a
      large and growing community of authors. DocBook is supported
      &#8220;out of the box&#8221; by a number of commercial tools,
      and support for it is rapidly growing in a number of free
      software environments. In short, DocBook is an
      easy-to-understand and widely used DTD. Dozens of
      organizations use DocBook for millions of pages of
      documentation, in various print and online formats,
      worldwide.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>This book is designed to be the clear, concise,
        normative reference to the DocBook DTD. This book is the
        official documentation for the DocBook DTD.</p>

        <p>We hope to answer, definitively, all the questions you
        might have about all the elements and entities in DocBook.
        In particular, we cover the following subjects:</p>

        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>The general nature of DocBook. With over 300
              elements, DocBook can be a bit overwhelming at first.
              We quickly get you up to speed on how the pieces fit
              together.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>How to write DocBook documents. Where should you
              start and what should you do?</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Parsing and validation. After you've written a
              document, how can you tell if it really conforms to
              the DocBook DTD?</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>How to publish DocBook documents. After you've
              written one, what do you do with it? We provide a
              guide to using some popular free tools to publish
              DocBook documents both in print and on the Web.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Customizing the DTD. Many individuals and
              corporations have standardized on the DocBook DTD.
              Whether your subject matter is computer software
              documentation or not, we explain how you can write a
              &#8220;customization layer&#8221; to tailor DocBook
              explicitly for your information.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Understanding all of the elements. Each element is
              extensively documented, including the intended
              semantics and the purpose of all its attributes. An
              example of proper usage is given for every element.
              The parameter entities and character entities are
              also described.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Stylesheets. Several standard stylesheet languages
              are briefly described.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>XML compatability. We outline all of the points
              that you'll need to consider as you or your
              organization contemplate XML for authoring,
              publishing, or both.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Additional resources and a CD-ROM. Finally, we
              direct you to other places you can go for all the
              latest info, and offer a complete set of online
              documentation on the CD-ROM.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>We expect that most readers will have some familiarity
        with SGML or XML. Even if your experience goes no farther
        than writing a few HTML pages, you're probably in good
        shape. Although we provide an introduction to SGML, XML,
        and structured markup, this book may not suffice as your
        only tutorial about SGML and XML. This depends, naturally,
        on your needs and experience. For a list of some other good
        resources, consult <a href="appd.html" title=
        "Resources">Appendix&#160;D</a>.</p>

        <p>Some sections of this book describe tools and
        applications. For the most part, these are Microsoft
        Windows or UNIX applications, although there's nothing
        about DocBook that makes it unsuitable for the Mac or
        VM/CMS or any other operating system of your choice.</p>

        <p>This book has been in the works for a long time. It
        could not have been completed without the help and
        encouragement of a lot of people, most especially my wife,
        Deborah, who supported me through the long hours and the
        late nights.</p>

        <p>I also want to thank Lenny for collaborating with me and
        developing real prose out of my rough outlines, cryptic
        email messages, and scribbled notes.</p>

        <p>A number of people contributed technical feedback as
        this book was being written, in particular Terry Allen and
        Eve Maler. I owe most of what I know about SGML to them,
        and to the other members of the Davenport Group who
        answered all my questions so many years ago, especially Jon
        Bosak, Eduardo Guttentag, and Murray Maloney. Paul Prescod,
        Mark Galassi, and Dave Pawson also provided invaluable
        feedback on the technical review draft. It's a better book
        because of them.</p>

        <p>My gratitude goes back to Dale Dougherty and Terry
        Allen, who long ago encouraged me and the production
        department at O'Reilly to learn SGML; and to Lar Kaufman,
        who also made large contributions to my knowledge and
        appreciation of SGML. But my greatest debt of thanks goes
        to Norm for all that he patiently taught me about DocBook,
        and for his supreme graciousness in keeping me a part of
        this project.</p>

        <p>Thanks finally to the great people at O'Reilly who
        encouraged us to write it (Frank Willison and Sheryl
        Avruch), agreed to edit it (Frank), helped design it
        (Alicia Cech, who worked on the interior design, and Edie
        Freeman, who designed the cover), proofed and produced it
        (Chris Maden, Madeline Newell, and David Futato), and
        indexed it (Ellen Troutman).</p>
