>&#13;      Cygwin is a Unix-like environment that runs within a Microsoft
      Windows system.  It is free, open source software.
      Cygwin consists primarily of shell commands and
      applications from the GNU/Linux environment.  Because it 
      supports the complete GNU suite of software development tools,
      including compilers for C, C++ and Fortran, many applications 
      for the Linux environment can simply be transferred to 
      Cygwin in source code form, compiled, linked and run. 
      Because Cygwin supports 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>sh</B
>,
      <B
CLASS="command"
>perl</B
>,
      <B
CLASS="command"
>python</B
>
      and the 
      <B
CLASS="command"
>cron</B
> batch scheduling system, it is
      an excellent environment for batch production on
      a windows system.
      Most applications developed to run 
      in the Cygwin environment can be transferred to Linux or Unix
      with almost no changes.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The first major application for the Cygwin environment by 
      the RFPK Software Team is a platform for testing SPK.
      Key portions of this application are written in the
      <B
CLASS="command"
>perl</B
> and
      <B
CLASS="command"
>sh</B
> scripting languages.  This tutorial
      describes the process of installing Cygwin on a Windows 
      machine for developing or running this or similar applications.

>&#13;      The default shell for Cygwin is
      <B
CLASS="command"
>sh</B
>,
      the Bash shell, which is a 
      version of the original Bourne shell enhanced in
      several ways, including the addition of command-line
      history and editing.  For portability, it is
      important to always write shell scripts for
      <B
CLASS="command"
>sh</B
> rather than for
      <B
CLASS="command"
>csh</B
>,
      <B
CLASS="command"
>tcsh</B
>,
      <B
CLASS="command"
>ksh</B
>,
      or any other shell.  It is recommended that RFPK developers
      use <B
CLASS="command"
>sh</B
> for all editing.
      including command-line editing, in order to eliminate
      confusion and because the current version has incorporated
      nearly all of the useful features that were pioneered by
      one or another of the above-named alternatives.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The Bash shell uses several configuration files, that it
      will read when it starts up, if they are located in your
      home directory.  A brief description of these files
      follows.
      <DIV

><P
>&#13;	      <A
NAME="login"
></A
>
	      Bash reads this file when you "log in."  With
	      Cygwin, you are, in effect, logging
	      in when you double-click the 
	      <TT
CLASS="guilabel"
><B
>Cygwin</B
></TT
> icon
	      on the desktop or in the 
	      <B
CLASS="guimenuitem"
>Start</B
> menu.
	    </P
><P
>&#13;	      The primary use of this file is to define environment
	      variables.  For example, the 
	      <TT
CLASS="varname"
>PAGER</TT
> environment variable tells
	      programs which paging command to use.  The default
	      is usually the <B
CLASS="command"
>more</B
>
	      command.  Most people find, however, that the
	      <B
CLASS="command"
>less</B
> command is superior.
	      You can instruct <B
CLASS="command"
>sh</B
>
	      and other programs that query the 
	      <TT
CLASS="varname"
>PAGER</TT
> variable
	      to use <B
CLASS="command"
>less</B
> by
	      placing the following commands in your
	      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.bash_profile</TT

	      because the shell script might not be run from 
	      a log-in shell.  For example, there is no login

	      <B
CLASS="command"
>vi</B
> or
	      <B

	      may need a number of arguments to specify exactly
	      which printer to use.  If you always use the
