<H1> B. The Organization of the Screen </H1>
<!--docid::SEC8::-->
<P>

  On a text-only terminal, the Emacs display occupies the whole screen.
On the X Window System, Emacs creates its own X windows to use.  We use
the term <EM>frame</EM> to mean an entire text-only screen or an entire X
window used by Emacs.  Emacs uses both kinds of frames in the same way
to display your editing.  Emacs normally starts out with just one frame,
but you can create additional frames if you wish.  See section <A HREF="emacs_19.html#SEC191">P. Frames and X Windows</A>.
</P><P>

  When you start Emacs, the entire frame except for the top and bottom
is devoted to the text you are editing.  This area is called the
<EM>window</EM>.  At the top there is normally a <EM>menu bar</EM> where you
can access a series of menus; then there may be a <EM>tool bar</EM>, a
row of icons that perform editing commands if you click on them.
Below this, the window begins.  The last line is a special <EM>echo
area</EM> or <EM>minibuffer window</EM>, where prompts appear and where you
can enter information when Emacs asks for it.  See below for more
information about these special lines.
</P><P>

  You can subdivide the large text window horizontally or vertically
into multiple text windows, each of which can be used for a different
file (see section <A HREF="emacs_18.html#SEC183">O. Multiple Windows</A>).  In this manual, the word "window" always
refers to the subdivisions of a frame within Emacs.
</P><P>

  The window that the cursor is in is the <EM>selected window</EM>, in
which editing takes place.  Most Emacs commands implicitly apply to the
text in the selected window (though mouse commands generally operate on
whatever window you click them in, whether selected or not).  The other
windows display text for reference only, unless/until you select them.
If you use multiple frames under the X Window System, then giving the
input focus to a particular frame selects a window in that frame.
</P><P>

  Each window's last line is a <EM>mode line</EM>, which describes what
is going on in that window.  It appears in inverse video, if the
terminal supports that; its contents normally begin with
<SAMP>`--:--  *scratch*'</SAMP> when Emacs starts.  The mode line
displays status information such as what buffer is being displayed
above it in the window, what major and minor modes are in use, and
whether the buffer contains unsaved changes.

<H2> B.1 Point </H2>
<!--docid::SEC9::-->
<P>

  Within Emacs, the terminal's cursor shows the location at which
editing commands will take effect.  This location is called <EM>point</EM>.
Many Emacs commands move point through the text, so that you can edit at
different places in it.  You can also place point by clicking mouse
button 1.
</P><P>

  While the cursor appears to point <EM>at</EM> a character, you should
think of point as <EM>between</EM> two characters; it points <EM>before</EM>
the character that appears under the cursor.  For example, if your text
looks like <SAMP>`frob'</SAMP> with the cursor over the <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, then point is
between the <SAMP>`o'</SAMP> and the <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>.  If you insert the character
<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> at that position, the result is <SAMP>`fro!b'</SAMP>, with point
between the <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> and the <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>.  Thus, the cursor remains over
the <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, as before.
</P><P>

  Sometimes people speak of "the cursor" when they mean "point," or
speak of commands that move point as "cursor motion" commands.
</P><P>

  Text-only terminals have only one cursor, and when output is in
progress it must appear where the output is being displayed.  This
does not mean that point is moving.  It is only that Emacs has no way
to show you the location of point except when the terminal is idle.
</P><P>

  If you are editing several files in Emacs, each in its own buffer,
each buffer has its own point location.  A buffer that is not currently
displayed remembers where point is in case you display it again later.
</P><P>

  When Emacs displays multiple windows, each window has its own point
location.  On text-only terminals, the cursor shows the location of
point in the selected window.  On graphical terminals, Emacs shows a
cursor in each window; the selected window's cursor is solid, and the
other cursors are hollow.  Either way, the cursor or cursors tell you
which window is selected.  If the same buffer appears in more than one
window, each window has its own position for point in that buffer, and
(when possible) its own cursor.
</P><P>

  See section <A HREF="emacs_13.html#SEC90">J.13 Displaying the Cursor</A>, for customization options that control display
of the cursor or cursors.
</P><P>

  The term "point" comes from the character <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>, which was the
command in TECO (the language in which the original Emacs was written)
for accessing the value now called "point."

<H2> B.2 The Echo Area </H2>
<!--docid::SEC10::-->
<P>

  The line at the bottom of the frame (below the mode line) is the
<EM>echo area</EM>.  It is used to display small amounts of text for
several purposes.
</P><P>

  <EM>Echoing</EM> means displaying the characters that you type.  Outside
Emacs, the operating system normally echoes all your input.  Emacs
handles echoing differently.
</P><P>

  Single-character commands do not echo in Emacs, and multi-character
commands echo only if you pause while typing them.  As soon as you pause
for more than a second in the middle of a command, Emacs echoes all the
characters of the command so far.  This is to <EM>prompt</EM> you for the
rest of the command.  Once echoing has started, the rest of the command
echoes immediately as you type it.  This behavior is designed to give
confident users fast response, while giving hesitant users maximum
feedback.  You can change this behavior by setting a variable
(see section <A HREF="emacs_13.html#SEC89">J.12 Customization of Display</A>).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
  If a command cannot be executed, it may display an <EM>error message</EM>
in the echo area.  Error messages are accompanied by beeping or by
flashing the screen.  The error also discards any input you have typed
ahead.
</P><P>

  Some commands display informative messages in the echo area.  These
messages look much like error messages, but they are not announced with
a beep and do not throw away input.  Sometimes the message tells you
what the command has done, when this is not obvious from looking at the
text being edited.  Sometimes the sole purpose of a command is to show
you a message giving you specific information--for example, <KBD>C-x =</KBD>
displays a message describing the character position of point in the text
and its current column in the window.  Commands that take a long time
often display messages ending in <SAMP>`...'</SAMP> while they are working, and
add <SAMP>`done'</SAMP> at the end when they are finished.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
  Echo-area informative messages are saved in an editor buffer named
<SAMP>`*Messages*'</SAMP>.  (We have not explained buffers yet; see
<A HREF="emacs_17.html#SEC172">N. Using Multiple Buffers</A>, for more information about them.)  If you miss a message
that appears briefly on the screen, you can switch to the
<SAMP>`*Messages*'</SAMP> buffer to see it again.  (Successive progress messages
are often collapsed into one in that buffer.)
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
  The size of <SAMP>`*Messages*'</SAMP> is limited to a certain number of lines.
The variable <CODE>message-log-max</CODE> specifies how many lines.  Once the
buffer has that many lines, each line added at the end deletes one line
from the beginning.  See section <A HREF="emacs_33.html#SEC477">AD.2 Variables</A>, for how to set variables such as
<CODE>message-log-max</CODE>.
</P><P>

  The echo area is also used to display the <EM>minibuffer</EM>, a window that
is used for reading arguments to commands, such as the name of a file to be
edited.  When the minibuffer is in use, the echo area begins with a prompt
string that usually ends with a colon; also, the cursor appears in that line
because it is the selected window.  You can always get out of the
minibuffer by typing <KBD>C-g</KBD>.  See section <A HREF="emacs_8.html#SEC31">E. The Minibuffer</A>.

</TR></TABLE>
<H2> B.3 The Mode Line </H2>
<!--docid::SEC11::-->
<P>

  Each text window's last line is a <EM>mode line</EM>, which describes
what is going on in that window.  When there is only one text window,
the mode line appears right above the echo area; it is the
next-to-last line in the frame.  The mode line starts and ends with
dashes.  On a text-mode display, the mode line is in inverse video if
the terminal supports that; on a graphics display, the mode line has a
3D box appearance to help it stand out.
</P><P>

  Normally, the mode line looks like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>-<VAR>cs</VAR>:<VAR>ch</VAR>  <VAR>buf</VAR>      (<VAR>major</VAR> <VAR>minor</VAR>)--<VAR>line</VAR>--<VAR>pos</VAR>------
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This gives information about the buffer being displayed in the window: the
buffer's name, what major and minor modes are in use, whether the buffer's
text has been changed, and how far down the buffer you are currently
looking.
</P><P>

  <VAR>ch</VAR> contains two stars <SAMP>`**'</SAMP> if the text in the buffer has
been edited (the buffer is "modified"), or <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> if the buffer has
not been edited.  For a read-only buffer, it is <SAMP>`%*'</SAMP> if the buffer
is modified, and <SAMP>`%%'</SAMP> otherwise.
</P><P>

  <VAR>buf</VAR> is the name of the window's <EM>buffer</EM>.  In most cases
this is the same as the name of a file you are editing.  See section <A HREF="emacs_17.html#SEC172">N. Using Multiple Buffers</A>.
</P><P>

  The buffer displayed in the selected window (the window that the
cursor is in) is also Emacs's current buffer, the one that editing
takes place in.  When we speak of what some command does to "the
buffer," we are talking about the current buffer.
</P><P>

  <VAR>line</VAR> is <SAMP>`L'</SAMP> followed by the current line number of point.
This is present when Line Number mode is enabled (which it normally is).
You can optionally display the current column number too, by turning on
Column Number mode (which is not enabled by default because it is
somewhat slower).  See section <A HREF="emacs_13.html#SEC87">J.10 Optional Mode Line Features</A>.
</P><P>

  <VAR>pos</VAR> tells you whether there is additional text above the top of
the window, or below the bottom.  If your buffer is small and it is all
visible in the window, <VAR>pos</VAR> is <SAMP>`All'</SAMP>.  Otherwise, it is
<SAMP>`Top'</SAMP> if you are looking at the beginning of the buffer, <SAMP>`Bot'</SAMP>
if you are looking at the end of the buffer, or <SAMP>`<VAR>nn</VAR>%'</SAMP>, where
<VAR>nn</VAR> is the percentage of the buffer above the top of the
window.</P><P>

  <VAR>major</VAR> is the name of the <EM>major mode</EM> in effect in the
buffer.  At any time, each buffer is in one and only one of the possible
major modes.  The major modes available include Fundamental mode (the
least specialized), Text mode, Lisp mode, C mode, Texinfo mode, and many
others.  See section <A HREF="emacs_21.html#SEC227">R. Major Modes</A>, for details of how the modes differ and how
to select one.</P><P>

  Some major modes display additional information after the major mode
name.  For example, Rmail buffers display the current message number and
the total number of messages.  Compilation buffers and Shell buffers
display the status of the subprocess.
</P><P>

  <VAR>minor</VAR> is a list of some of the <EM>minor modes</EM> that are turned
on at the moment in the window's chosen buffer.  For example,
<SAMP>`Fill'</SAMP> means that Auto Fill mode is on.  <SAMP>`Abbrev'</SAMP> means that
Word Abbrev mode is on.  <SAMP>`Ovwrt'</SAMP> means that Overwrite mode is on.
See section <A HREF="emacs_33.html#SEC476">AD.1 Minor Modes</A>, for more information.  <SAMP>`Narrow'</SAMP> means that the
buffer being displayed has editing restricted to only a portion of its
text.  This is not really a minor mode, but is like one.
See section <A HREF="emacs_32.html#SEC462">AC.22 Narrowing</A>.  <SAMP>`Def'</SAMP> means that a keyboard macro is being
defined.  See section <A HREF="emacs_33.html#SEC487">AD.3 Keyboard Macros</A>.
</P><P>

  In addition, if Emacs is currently inside a recursive editing level,
square brackets (<SAMP>`[<small>...</small>]'</SAMP>) appear around the parentheses that
surround the modes.  If Emacs is in one recursive editing level within
another, double square brackets appear, and so on.  Since recursive
editing levels affect Emacs globally, not just one buffer, the square
brackets appear in every window's mode line or not in any of them.
See section <A HREF="emacs_32.html#SEC466">AC.26 Recursive Editing Levels</A>.</P><P>

  Non-windowing terminals can only show a single Emacs frame at a time
(see section <A HREF="emacs_19.html#SEC191">P. Frames and X Windows</A>).  On such terminals, the mode line displays the name of
the selected frame, after <VAR>ch</VAR>.  The initial frame's name is
<SAMP>`F1'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

  <VAR>cs</VAR> states the coding system used for the file you are editing.
A dash indicates the default state of affairs: no code conversion,
except for end-of-line translation if the file contents call for that.
<SAMP>`='</SAMP> means no conversion whatsoever.  Nontrivial code conversions
are represented by various letters--for example, <SAMP>`1'</SAMP> refers to ISO
Latin-1.  See section <A HREF="emacs_20.html#SEC220">Q.7 Coding Systems</A>, for more information.  If you are using
an input method, a string of the form <SAMP>`<VAR>i</VAR>&#62;'</SAMP> is added to the
beginning of <VAR>cs</VAR>; <VAR>i</VAR> identifies the input method.  (Some input
methods show <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP>.)  See section <A HREF="emacs_20.html#SEC217">Q.4 Input Methods</A>.
</P><P>

  When you are using a character-only terminal (not a window system),
<VAR>cs</VAR> uses three characters to describe, respectively, the coding
system for keyboard input, the coding system for terminal output, and
the coding system used for the file you are editing.
</P><P>

  When multibyte characters are not enabled, <VAR>cs</VAR> does not appear at
all.  See section <A HREF="emacs_20.html#SEC215">Q.2 Enabling Multibyte Characters</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
  The colon after <VAR>cs</VAR> can change to another string in certain
circumstances.  Emacs uses newline characters to separate lines in the buffer.
Some files use different conventions for separating lines: either
carriage-return linefeed (the MS-DOS convention) or just carriage-return
(the Macintosh convention).  If the buffer's file uses carriage-return
linefeed, the colon changes to either a backslash (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>) or
<SAMP>`(DOS)'</SAMP>, depending on the operating system.  If the file uses just
carriage-return, the colon indicator changes to either a forward slash
(<SAMP>`/'</SAMP>) or <SAMP>`(Mac)'</SAMP>.  On some systems, Emacs displays
<SAMP>`(Unix)'</SAMP> instead of the colon even for files that use newline to
separate lines.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
  You can customize the mode line display for each of the end-of-line
formats by setting each of the variables <CODE>eol-mnemonic-unix</CODE>,
<CODE>eol-mnemonic-dos</CODE>, <CODE>eol-mnemonic-mac</CODE>, and
<CODE>eol-mnemonic-undecided</CODE> to any string you find appropriate.
See section <A HREF="emacs_33.html#SEC477">AD.2 Variables</A>, for an explanation of how to set variables.
</P><P>

  See section <A HREF="emacs_13.html#SEC87">J.10 Optional Mode Line Features</A>, for features that add other handy
information to the mode line, such as the current column number of
point, the current time, and whether new mail for you has arrived.
</P><P>

The mode line is mouse-sensitive; when you move the mouse across
various parts of it, Emacs displays help text to say what a click in
that place will do.  See section <A HREF="emacs_19.html#SEC197">P.6 Mode Line Mouse Commands</A>.

<!--docid::SEC12::-->
<P>

  Each Emacs frame normally has a <EM>menu bar</EM> at the top which you
can use to perform certain common operations.  There's no need to list

<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
  When you are using a window system, you can use the mouse to choose a
command from the menu bar.  An arrow pointing right, after the menu
item, indicates that the item leads to a subsidiary menu; <SAMP>`...'</SAMP> at
the end means that the command will read arguments from the keyboard
before it actually does anything.
</P><P>

  To view the full command name and documentation for a menu item, type
<KBD>C-h k</KBD>, and then select the menu bar with the mouse in the usual

  On text-only terminals with no mouse, you can use the menu bar by
typing <KBD>M-`</KBD> or <KBD>F10</KBD> (these run the command
<CODE>tmm-menubar</CODE>).  This command enters a mode in which you can select
a menu item from the keyboard.  A provisional choice appears in the echo
area.  You can use the left and right arrow keys to move through the
menu to different choices.  When you have found the choice you want,
type <KBD>RET</KBD> to select it.
</P><P>

  Each menu item also has an assigned letter or digit which designates
that item; it is usually the initial of some word in the item's name.
This letter or digit is separated from the item name by <SAMP>`=&#62;'</SAMP>.  You
can type the item's letter or digit to select the item.
</P><P>

  Some of the commands in the menu bar have ordinary key bindings as
well; if so, the menu lists one equivalent key binding in parentheses
after the item itself.

<H2> B.5 Kinds of User Input </H2>
<!--docid::SEC13::-->
<P>

  GNU Emacs uses an extension of the ASCII character set for keyboard
input; it also accepts non-character input events including function
keys and mouse button actions.
</P><P>

  ASCII consists of 128 character codes.  Some of these codes are
assigned graphic symbols such as <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`='</SAMP>; the rest are
control characters, such as <KBD>Control-a</KBD> (usually written <KBD>C-a</KBD>
for short).  <KBD>C-a</KBD> gets its name from the fact that you type it by
holding down the <KBD>CTRL</KBD> key while pressing <KBD>a</KBD>.
</P><P>

  Some ASCII control characters have special names, and most terminals
have special keys you can type them with: for example, <KBD>RET</KBD>,
<KBD>TAB</KBD>, <KBD>DEL</KBD> and <KBD>ESC</KBD>.  The space character is usually
referred to below as <KBD>SPC</KBD>, even though strictly speaking it is a
graphic character whose graphic happens to be blank.  Some keyboards
have a key labeled "linefeed" which is an alias for <KBD>C-j</KBD>.
</P><P>

  Emacs extends the ASCII character set with thousands more printing
characters (see section <A HREF="emacs_20.html#SEC213">Q. International Character Set Support</A>), additional control characters, and a
few more modifiers that can be combined with any character.
</P><P>

  On ASCII terminals, there are only 32 possible control characters.
These are the control variants of letters and <SAMP>`@[]\^_'</SAMP>.  In
addition, the shift key is meaningless with control characters:
<KBD>C-a</KBD> and <KBD>C-A</KBD> are the same character, and Emacs cannot
distinguish them.
</P><P>

  But the Emacs character set has room for control variants of all
printing characters, and for distinguishing between <KBD>C-a</KBD> and
<KBD>C-A</KBD>.  The X Window System makes it possible to enter all these
characters.  For example, <KBD>C--</KBD> (that's Control-Minus) and <KBD>C-5</KBD>
are meaningful Emacs commands under X.
</P><P>

  Another Emacs character-set extension is additional modifier bits.
Only one modifier bit is commonly used; it is called Meta.  Every
character has a Meta variant; examples include <KBD>Meta-a</KBD> (normally
written <KBD>M-a</KBD>, for short), <KBD>M-A</KBD> (not the same character as
<KBD>M-a</KBD>, but those two characters normally have the same meaning in
Emacs), <KBD>M-<KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>, and <KBD>M-C-a</KBD>.  For reasons of tradition,
we usually write <KBD>C-M-a</KBD> rather than <KBD>M-C-a</KBD>; logically
speaking, the order in which the modifier keys <KBD>CTRL</KBD> and <KBD>META</KBD>
are mentioned does not matter.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
  Some terminals have a <KBD>META</KBD> key, and allow you to type Meta
characters by holding this key down.  Thus, <KBD>Meta-a</KBD> is typed by
holding down <KBD>META</KBD> and pressing <KBD>a</KBD>.  The <KBD>META</KBD> key
works much like the <KBD>SHIFT</KBD> key.  Such a key is not always labeled
<KBD>META</KBD>, however, as this function is often a special option for a
key with some other primary purpose.  Sometimes it is labeled
<KBD>ALT</KBD> or <KBD>EDIT</KBD>; on a Sun keyboard, it may have a diamond on
it.
</P><P>

  If there is no <KBD>META</KBD> key, you can still type Meta characters
using two-character sequences starting with <KBD>ESC</KBD>.  Thus, you can enter
<KBD>M-a</KBD> by typing <KBD><KBD>ESC</KBD> a</KBD>.  You can enter <KBD>C-M-a</KBD> by
typing <KBD><KBD>ESC</KBD> C-a</KBD>.  <KBD>ESC</KBD> is allowed on terminals with
<KBD>META</KBD> keys, too, in case you have formed a habit of using it.
  
  The X Window System provides several other modifier keys that can be
applied to any input character.  These are called <KBD>SUPER</KBD>,
<KBD>HYPER</KBD> and <KBD>ALT</KBD>.  We write <SAMP>`s-'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`H-'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`A-'</SAMP>
to say that a character uses these modifiers.  Thus, <KBD>s-H-C-x</KBD> is
short for <KBD>Super-Hyper-Control-x</KBD>.  Not all X terminals actually
provide keys for these modifier flags--in fact, many terminals have a
key labeled <KBD>ALT</KBD> which is really a <KBD>META</KBD> key.  The standard
key bindings of Emacs do not include any characters with these
modifiers.  But you can assign them meanings of your own by customizing
Emacs.
</P><P>

  Keyboard input includes keyboard keys that are not characters at all:
for example function keys and arrow keys.  Mouse buttons are also
outside the gamut of characters.  You can modify these events with the
modifier keys <KBD>CTRL</KBD>, <KBD>META</KBD>, <KBD>SUPER</KBD>, <KBD>HYPER</KBD> and
<KBD>ALT</KBD>, just like keyboard characters.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
  Input characters and non-character inputs are collectively called
<EM>input events</EM>.  See section `Input Events' in <CITE>The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</CITE>, for more information.  If you are not doing Lisp
programming, but simply want to redefine the meaning of some characters
or non-character events, see <A HREF="emacs_33.html#SEC475">AD. Customization</A>.
</P><P>

  ASCII terminals cannot really send anything to the computer except
ASCII characters.  These terminals use a sequence of characters to
represent each function key.  But that is invisible to the Emacs user,
because the keyboard input routines recognize these special sequences
and convert them to function key events before any other part of Emacs
gets to see them.

<H2> B.6 Keys </H2>
<!--docid::SEC14::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
  A <EM>key sequence</EM> (<EM>key</EM>, for short) is a sequence of input
events that are meaningful as a unit--as "a single command."  Some
Emacs command sequences are just one character or one event; for
example, just <KBD>C-f</KBD> is enough to move forward one character in the
buffer.  But Emacs also has commands that take two or more events to
invoke.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
  If a sequence of events is enough to invoke a command, it is a
<EM>complete key</EM>.  Examples of complete keys include <KBD>C-a</KBD>,
<KBD>X</KBD>, <KBD>RET</KBD>, <KBD>NEXT</KBD> (a function key), <KBD>DOWN</KBD> (an arrow
key), <KBD>C-x C-f</KBD>, and <KBD>C-x 4 C-f</KBD>.  If it isn't long enough to be
complete, we call it a <EM>prefix key</EM>.  The above examples show that
<KBD>C-x</KBD> and <KBD>C-x 4</KBD> are prefix keys.  Every key sequence is either
a complete key or a prefix key.
</P><P>

  Most single characters constitute complete keys in the standard Emacs
command bindings.  A few of them are prefix keys.  A prefix key combines
with the following input event to make a longer key sequence, which may
itself be complete or a prefix.  For example, <KBD>C-x</KBD> is a prefix key,
so <KBD>C-x</KBD> and the next input event combine to make a two-event
key sequence.  Most of these key sequences are complete keys, including
<KBD>C-x C-f</KBD> and <KBD>C-x b</KBD>.  A few, such as <KBD>C-x 4</KBD> and <KBD>C-x
r</KBD>, are themselves prefix keys that lead to three-event key
sequences.  There's no limit to the length of a key sequence, but in
practice people rarely use sequences longer than four events.
</P><P>

  By contrast, you can't add more events onto a complete key.  For
example, the two-event sequence <KBD>C-f C-k</KBD> is not a key, because
the <KBD>C-f</KBD> is a complete key in itself.  It's impossible to give
<KBD>C-f C-k</KBD> an independent meaning as a command.  <KBD>C-f C-k</KBD> is two
key sequences, not one.</P><P>

  All told, the prefix keys in Emacs are <KBD>C-c</KBD>, <KBD>C-h</KBD>,
<KBD>C-x</KBD>, <KBD>C-x <KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>, <KBD>C-x @</KBD>, <KBD>C-x a</KBD>, <KBD>C-x n</KBD>, <KBD>C-x
r</KBD>, <KBD>C-x v</KBD>, <KBD>C-x 4</KBD>, <KBD>C-x 5</KBD>, <KBD>C-x 6</KBD>, <KBD>ESC</KBD>, and
<KBD>M-g</KBD>.  But this list is not cast in concrete; it is
just a matter of Emacs's standard key bindings.  If you customize Emacs,
you can make new prefix keys, or eliminate these.  See section <A HREF="emacs_33.html#SEC491">AD.4 Customizing Key Bindings</A>.
</P><P>

  If you do make or eliminate prefix keys, that changes the set of
possible key sequences.  For example, if you redefine <KBD>C-f</KBD> as a
prefix, <KBD>C-f C-k</KBD> automatically becomes a key (complete, unless you
define that too as a prefix).  Conversely, if you remove the prefix
definition of <KBD>C-x 4</KBD>, then <KBD>C-x 4 f</KBD> (or <KBD>C-x 4
<VAR>anything</VAR></KBD>) is no longer a key.
</P><P>

  Typing the help character (<KBD>C-h</KBD> or <KBD>F1</KBD>) after a prefix
key displays a list of the commands starting with that prefix.
There are a few prefix keys for which <KBD>C-h</KBD> does not
work--for historical reasons, they have other meanings for <KBD>C-h</KBD>
which are not easy to change.  But <KBD>F1</KBD> should work for all prefix
keys.

<H2> B.7 Keys and Commands </H2>
<!--docid::SEC15::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
  This manual is full of passages that tell you what particular keys
do.  But Emacs does not assign meanings to keys directly.  Instead,
Emacs assigns meanings to named <EM>commands</EM>, and then gives keys
their meanings by <EM>binding</EM> them to commands.
</P><P>

  Every command has a name chosen by a programmer.  The name is usually
made of a few English words separated by dashes; for example,
<CODE>next-line</CODE> or <CODE>forward-word</CODE>.  A command also has a
<EM>function definition</EM> which is a Lisp program; this is what makes
the command do what it does.  In Emacs Lisp, a command is actually a
special kind of Lisp function; one which specifies how to read arguments
for it and call it interactively.  For more information on commands and
functions, see section `What Is a Function' in <CITE>The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</CITE>.  (The definition we use in this manual is
simplified slightly.)
</P><P>

  The bindings between keys and commands are recorded in various tables
called <EM>keymaps</EM>.  See section <A HREF="emacs_33.html#SEC492">AD.4.1 Keymaps</A>.
</P><P>

  When we say that "<KBD>C-n</KBD> moves down vertically one line" we are
glossing over a distinction that is irrelevant in ordinary use but is vital
in understanding how to customize Emacs.  It is the command
<CODE>next-line</CODE> that is programmed to move down vertically.  <KBD>C-n</KBD> has
this effect <EM>because</EM> it is bound to that command.  If you rebind
<KBD>C-n</KBD> to the command <CODE>forward-word</CODE> then <KBD>C-n</KBD> will move
forward by words instead.  Rebinding keys is a common method of
customization.</P><P>

  In the rest of this manual, we usually ignore this subtlety to keep
things simple.  To give the information needed for customization, we
state the name of the command which really does the work in parentheses
after mentioning the key that runs it.  For example, we will say that
"The command <KBD>C-n</KBD> (<CODE>next-line</CODE>) moves point vertically
down," meaning that <CODE>next-line</CODE> is a command that moves vertically
down, and <KBD>C-n</KBD> is a key that is normally bound to it.
</P><P>

  While we are on the subject of information for customization only,
it's a good time to tell you about <EM>variables</EM>.  Often the
description of a command will say, "To change this, set the variable
<CODE>mumble-foo</CODE>."  A variable is a name used to remember a value.
Most of the variables documented in this manual exist just to facilitate
customization: some command or other part of Emacs examines the variable
and behaves differently according to the value that you set.  Until you
are interested in customizing, you can ignore the information about
variables.  When you are ready to be interested, read the basic
information on variables, and then the information on individual
variables will make sense.  See section <A HREF="emacs_33.html#SEC477">AD.2 Variables</A>.

<H2> B.8 Character Set for Text </H2>
<!--docid::SEC16::-->
<P>

  Text in Emacs buffers is a sequence of 8-bit bytes.  Each byte can
hold a single ASCII character.  Both ASCII control characters (octal
codes 000 through 037, and 0177) and ASCII printing characters (codes
040 through 0176) are allowed; however, non-ASCII control characters
cannot appear in a buffer.  The other modifier flags used in keyboard
input, such as Meta, are not allowed in buffers either.
</P><P>

  Some ASCII control characters serve special purposes in text, and have
special names.  For example, the newline character (octal code 012) is
used in the buffer to end a line, and the tab character (octal code 011)
is used for indenting to the next tab stop column (normally every 8
columns).  See section <A HREF="emacs_13.html#SEC88">J.11 How Text Is Displayed</A>.
</P><P>

  Non-ASCII printing characters can also appear in buffers.  When
multibyte characters are enabled, you can use any of the non-ASCII
printing characters that Emacs supports.  They have character codes
starting at 256, octal 0400, and each one is represented as a sequence
of two or more bytes.  See section <A HREF="emacs_20.html#SEC213">Q. International Character Set Support</A>.  Single-byte characters
with codes 128 through 255 can also appear in multibyte buffers.
</P><P>

  If you disable multibyte characters, then you can use only one
alphabet of non-ASCII characters, but they all fit in one byte.  They
use codes 0200 through 0377.  See section <A HREF="emacs_20.html#SEC226">Q.13 Single-byte Character Set Support</A>.
