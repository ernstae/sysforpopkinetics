<h1><a name="abstract">ABSTRACT</a></h1>
<p>The SPK run daemon executes continuously on the CSPK server. It
selects jobs from the run queue, forks processes to compile, link
and run them and, finally, inserts results into the database.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="arguments">ARGUMENTS</a></h2>
<p>The program expects the following arguments:</p>
<pre>
    $database
        The name of the SPK database
    $dbhost
        The host on which the SPK database resides
    $dbuser
        A database username which has read/write access to the job table
    $dbpasswd
        The password associated with the username
    $mode
        The test mode indicator being &quot;test&quot; for test mode, &quot;prod&quot; for production mode 
    $shost
        The host on which the job-queue server resides
    $sport
        The port of the job-queue server
    $pvm
        The using PVM indicator being &quot;on&quot; for using PVM, 'off' otherwise
    $max_concurrent
        Maximum number of concurrent running jobs
    $max_ntasks
        Maximum number of tasks for a job</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="operation">OPERATION</a></h2>
<p>The first thing that spkrun.pl does after starting up is to call
Proc::Daemon::Init to make it into a daemon, by shedding its
inheirited environment and becoming a direct child of the system init
process.</p>
<p>It then opens the system log so that it has a place to record progress
and error messages.</p>
<p>It attempts to create a lock-file if one does not already exist. The
method that is used assures that the process of query and creation is
atomic.  If the lock-file already exists, the program writes an error
message to the system log and terminates, because only one copy of
spkrund.pl can be allowed to run at any given time.</p>
<p>Next, it opens the database and connects to the job-queue server.</p>
<p>The program designates itself to be a process group leader. This way
it will be able to send signals to all of its descendents without
having to know their PIDs.</p>
<p>The ``stop'' subroutine is designated to catch the TERM signal, when it
is received. As explained below, this will allow for an orderly
shutdown of the daemon and its sub-processes.  It closes 
the connection to the database and the connection to the job-queue 
server.</p>
<p>The last major step in the start-up sequence is to talk to the 
job-queue server to put any running jobs back to run queue 
that were interupted by the last termination of this daemon, and 
to put any aborting jobs back to aborting run queue that were 
interupted by the last termination of this daemon</p>
<p>At this point, the program enters an endless loop from which it will
escape only upon receipt of a signal. It queries the job-queue server to
discover whether or not a job has been added to the run queue.  If so,
a copy of the job's driver is started as an independent sub-process,
working in its own directory.</p>
<p>The program also queries the job-queue server to discover whether or not 
a job has been added to the aborting run queue.  If so, a 'TERM' signal 
is sent to the child process of the job to terminate the child process. 
To avoid the ``stop'' subroutine, which is for the termination of the 
daemon, being called, the signal mask is temporarily set.</p>
<p>The daemon then checks to see if any child processes have terminated.
If so, it moves them to ``end'' status and stores the results in the 
database. The daemon sleeps a second, before continuing its loop.</p>
<p>The normal way in which spkcmp.pl is terminated is by using the Unix
``kill'' command to send it the TERM signal.  When TERM is received,
execution is passed to the 'stop' subroutine, which had previously
been designated to catch this signal.</p>
<p>To avoid a loop, 'stop' sets the signal mask to ignore any subsequent
TERM signals. It then sends the TERM signal to every process in its
process group, which consists of the daemon itself and all of its
descendents. It waits for all descendents (which are job drivers) to
terminate.  It closes the database and the system log, then dies.</p>
<p>NOTE: Life-Cycle of the Working Directory Name</p>
<pre>
  1. A working directory must be created before each run-time is 
     forked so that the process will start up in its own unique space.
     There it will find all of the files created for it by the SPK
     compiler and there it will write its output.  To insure that the
     name of the working directory is unique, a suffix of the form
     &quot;-job-jjjj&quot; is appended to the name, where &quot;jjjj&quot; is the unique
     job_id that was assigned by the database management system when
     the job was created. 
  2. Once the working directory has been created, the daemon uses the
     tar application to expand the contents of the &quot;cpp_source&quot; field
     of the row for this job in the job table of the database. In effect,
     it recreates the working directory as it was on the server which
     hosts the SPK compiler at the time that compiler finished its
     work with the job. The source code and data needed for the run
     are placed there.
  3. When the process is forked into a parent process and a child
     process, the Linux or Unix operating system assigns a process
     identifier (pid) number to the child.  Process identifiers are
     recycled, but only after a long time or when the system is 
     rebooted.  The parent finds the working directories of its
     children by maintaining a table relating pid to job_id. 
  4. When a child process dies, the parent receives its pid as the 
     value returned from the waitpid system call.  Using this, it
     easily constructs the name of the working directory. After 
     extracting results and placing them in the database, the 
     working directory is normally removed, unless the constant 
     $retain_working_directory has been initialized to be true, or
     in case the run died due to an internal error. So that the
     retained working directory can be easily identified by software
     maintainers.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="end_code_and_error_reporting">END_CODE AND ERROR REPORTING</a></h2>
<p>Because the deamon is the parent of all jobs, it is informed as soon
as a job driver terminates.  The operating system provides the daemon
with three very useful numbers describing the deceased driver: the
process identifier (pid), the exit status and, in the case where the
driver is terminated with a kill signal, the signal number.</p>
<p>The end-code will be set to ``srun'', which indicates a successful run,
only if the exit status and the signal number are both zero and if, in
addition, no file called ``software error'' is found in the job's
working directory.</p>
<p>If the signal number is SIGTERM, which indicates that the job was
terminated by an operator, a software error of some sort is assumed
and end_code is set to ``serr''.  It may be that the only error is that
the optimization failed to converge in a reasonable period of time.
Only subsequent analysis will determine what the problem was.</p>
<p>If the signal number is SIGABRT, this indicates that the software
itself discovered some internal inconsistency and terminated by
raising an ``assertion''.  In this case, end_code is also set to ``serr''.</p>
<p>If the signal number is SIGKILL, this indicates that the job is set to
abort.</p>
<p>If the job terminated with any signal other than SIGTERM or SIGABRT, a
hardware error is assumed, and the end_code is set to ``herr''. Of
course, many hardware errors are really caused by software, such as
when the software attempts to divide a number by zero or when it
attempts a reference via an invalid pointer.</p>
<p>If the signal number is zero, indicating that the job did not
terminate as the result of a signal, but the exit status is not zero,
end_code is set to ``serr''.</p>
<p>If the daemon finds a file called ``software error'', end_code is always
set to ``serr'' and it is assumed that an assertion was raised.  In this
case, the SIGABRT signal was probably also reported.</p>
<p>The daemon analyzes the various cases described above, and generates
an error messages which is written to the report which goes into the
database, to be made available to the end user, as well as to the
system log, where it is available to developers and system
adminstrators.</p>
<p>If the end_code is not ``abrt'', the daemon sends an end-job email notice 
to the user on the user's request.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="returns">RETURNS</a></h1>
<p>Nothing, because it has no parent (other than init) to which an exit
code might be returned.  The program does, however, write event
messages to the system log.</p>
