>&#13;      RFPK uses software known as the
      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Automated NCRR Annual Report Package</I
>
      for preparing its annual report for the NIH.
      This software was obtained from Michael Riffle, of the Department
      of Biochemistry, who may have been its author. The version of the
      package that we have seems to have been developed or configured 
      for the Yeast Resource Center (YRC). The acronym <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>YRC</I
>
      appears as the database name and in several path names of the configuration.
      In this document the software will generally be referred to 
      simply as the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>package</I
>.

>&#13;      The package is a web application built around a MySQL database.  It
      appears to have been designed so that various researchers could use 
      it to maintain information about their own projects.  Because they
      would interact with the package via the public internet, a security
      scheme was implemented, which included the concept of session and the use
      of the secure socket layer (SSL).  With the original security 
      architecture intact, it would have required a fair amount of work
      to port the system to current versions of the Apache web server
      and the MySQL relational database management system.  Since Paolo
      Vicini is the only user of the package at RFPK, it was decided
      to disable the SSL features.  The security issue, nevertheless,
      had to be addressed, due to the fact that Paolo's workstation
      resides on the public internet. The solution chosen was to rely on the
      firewall to bar access to all IP addresses except that of Paolo's
      workstation.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The domain name of the firewall is <TT
CLASS="filename"
>spk.rfpk.washington.edu</TT
>.
      The package can be securely accessed from outside the firewall by using
      two of the firewall's features:
      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    Port forwarding.  Traffic to an IP port on
	    <TT
CLASS="filename"
>spk.rfpk.washington.edu</TT
>
	    can be forwarded to the same or any other port on any
	    host behind the firewall.  A port number must be chosen that is
	    not already being forwarded to another machine.  For this package
	    we use the port 8082 and have it forwarded to port 80 on the 
	    server on which the package is installed.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	    External access control.  A list of IP addresses that can access
	    this port must be provided.  This list would include the IP address
	    of Paolo Vicini's workstation.  If required, additional IP addresses
	    could be added.

>&#13;	At present, the package is installed entirely on whitechuck, which is
	backed up to tape on a weekly basis.  This is a <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>raw</I
>
	backup, in that everything is simply copied to the tape.  Much of the
	information is in a binary form.  This information is certainly 
	sufficient to restore the database in case of damage.  In order to
	accomplish this, all of the files associated with MySQL could be copied
	from tape to disk, using the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>restore</I
> function of
	the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>xbru</I
> utility, which is part of the tape backup
	system installed on whitechuck.
      </P

>&#13;	Restoring from the backup tape should only be used as a last resort,
	however, for the following reasons:
	<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      The tape backup is taken only once a week.  Information 
	      added to the database between the time of the last backup and
	      the time of the database failure is lost.
	    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	      Care must be taken to restore only the files associated with
	      the YRC database and not with the SPK databases.  This is
	      a risky undertaking.  If not done properly, transactions might
	      be lost from the SPK databases.
	    </P
></LI
></UL
>
      </P
><P
>&#13;	A nightly symbolic backup is also taken.  A script that uses
	<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>mysqldump</I
> is used.  It is run on a 
	workstation in the home directory of the workstation's principal
	user (currently jambutty, used by alan).  This way, the dump 
	goes onto a hard disk on a machine separate from the server.  
	The user's home directory is also backed up to whitechuck each
	work day night, providing another copy.  On whitechuck, these
	home directory backups are retained for a certain period, providing
	the ability to revert the database several days, if needed.
