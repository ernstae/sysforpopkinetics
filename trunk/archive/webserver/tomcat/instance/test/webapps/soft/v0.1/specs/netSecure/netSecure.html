>&#13;	SPK is implemented on the user's workstation and a network
	of servers.  Network security is important from the 
	point of view of the privacy of data about human subjects, 
	the proprietary nature of some PK models, and the reliability
	expected of a serious research tool.
	This document describes the specific network architecture
	that has been installed by RFPK to support the initial
	version of SPK.  It is envisioned to become a model for 
	SPK installations elsewhere.

>Physical Security</I
>. The physical
	    security of buildings and rooms in which computers are
	    contained is an important component in the overall security
	    of the network.  At RFPK, the building and the lab are
	    locked evenings, nights, and weekends.  During normal
	    business hours, however, anyone can walk in.  This 
	    situation, which is appropriate for a facility that
	    is involved in the education of students, 
	    is not ideal from
	    a security viewpoint.  Other installations might well
	    choose to take additional precautions. This topic will
	    not be mentioned further in this document.

>Level of Security</I
>. Security is not cost
	    free.  In fact, it can be quite expensive.  Absolute security
	    would be infinitely expensive. The goal is to reach the
	    right balance. The level of security that is right for one
	    organization might be too high or too low for another. At
	    RFPK, we have adopted a strategy for security similar to 
	    that for the technology we have chosen. SPK is a built on web-services 
	    technology which, although highly sophisticated, is available
	    to us for free or very inexpensively because it is the 
	    technology of electronic commerce, rather than a special-purpose
	    technology. Similarly, we have
	    adopted the security model of e-commerce. We strive to be
	    as secure as, for example, Amazon.com.  Trying to be more
	    secure would be difficult and very expensive.

>Compatibility</I
>. The RFPK lab is 
	    situated on the campus of the University of Washington.
	    Our network is part of the UW network.  We have chosen
	    a network security architecture which fits smoothly and
	    nearly transparently into the UW network. Because the
	    UW network is typical of what would be found at most
	    universities and research organizations, we believe
	    that our design has broad applicability.  Enterprises
	    with significantly different network infrastructure
	    will, of course, make other choices.

>Client Security</H2
><P
>&#13;      Users work on laptops or workstations, which can use any of the
      following operating system families:  Windows, Macintosh,
      Linux or Unix.  To work as part of SPK, a client machine must
      be connected to the public internet.  Just connecting to the
      public internet introduces a level of insecurity, especially for 
      users of Windows, because of the frequent attacks by viruses
      and worms.  These risks can be minimized by employing anti-virus
      software, individual firewalls, by never opening executable
      email attachments, etc.  This aspect of network security is the
      responsibility of the user.  It should not be forgotten, however,
      that a compromised workstation may compromise the security of
      its user's participation in SPK.

>Java Runtime Engine (JRE)</I

	    software provides the java virtual machine needed to
	    run the MDA.  In some cases,
	    a suitable JRE is already present on the client machine,
	    because it is packaged with the operating system
	    (for example Macintosh, Solaris, most varieties of Linux).
	    In all other cases, it must be downloaded securely from
	    a site operated by Sun Microsystems.
	  </P

>Java WebStart</I

	    needed to download the MDA.  It also automatically updates
	    the MDA whenever revisions are available.  In some cases,
	    WebStart is already installed on the client, because it
	    is packaged with the operating system (Macintosh, for
	    example).  In all other cases it must be downloaded
	    securely from a site operated by Sun Microsystems.

CLASS="emphasis"
>Server Authentication</I
>. The user starts a
	    session with SPK by connecting to the SPK web server, using
	    a browser. Because the Spk web site is a 
	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>secure</I
> web site, the communication is via the
	    <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>https</I
> protocol, which provides the 
	    the user with a guarantee that the server is
	    the genuine SPK web server and not an impostor.  This
	    validation is achieved when the server presents to the
	    browser an authentication certificate signed by a 
	    certificate authority recognized by the browser.

CLASS="emphasis"
>SSL</I
>. All communication between either the
	    user's browser or the MDA on the one hand, and the web server
	    on the other, uses a protocol
	    known as the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</I
>.
	    All messages are encrypted using a 128-bit encryption
	    key. This technology is identical to that used to protect
	    credit card transactions at e-commerce web sites.

CLASS="emphasis"
>User Authentication</I
>. In order to access
	    the services of SPK, a user must log in by providing a
	    username and a password. This communication is encrypted using
	    SSL, as are all other messages.  By logging in, the user
	    provides SPK with proof that he or she is not an impostor.

>WebStart</I
>. The first time that the
	    user clicks on the link for requesting the services of the 
	    MDA, WebStart downloads the latest version of the software
	    from the server to the client machine.  Each subsequent
	    time that this occurs, WebStart downloads an update if
	    a newer version is available, insuring that the user is
	    always running the latest software. All downloads are
	    encrypted.

>. Since the 
	    MDA resides on the client's machine, it would be possible
	    for a malefactor to modify the MDA to perform in ways
	    that would jeopardize security.  This is prevented by
	    WebStart, however, which refuses to run an MDA that
	    has been modified since downloaded.

>&#13;      In the previous section, client security was discussed.  The rest of
      SPK is provided by various servers. These servers are typically
      located in once place, hence the traffic between them does not
      pass over the public internet.  Encryption is not a requirement.
      On the other hand, it is critical to protect them from external
      attacks, which could make them unavailable to users or could allow
      sensitive information to be stolen or tampered with.

CLASS="emphasis"
>Web Server</I
>. This is the only server that

	    </P

><LI

>&#13;	      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Database Server</I
>. This server should not
	      be reachable from the public internet.  It must, however,
	      accept database connections from the web server. It must
	      not accept connections of any other sort from the web
	      server.

>&#13;	      <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Computational Server (CSPK Server)</I

	      Like the application server, the computational
	      server should not be reachable from the public internet
	      and it must be able to establish database connections
	      to the database server.

>&#13;	It is not necessary that each of the above servers be hosted on
	a separate machine. All servers could reside on a single machine.
	It would be preferable from a security point of view, however, to
	have at least two machines: one for the web server and the other
	for the rest, because the web server is reachable from the
	public internet.
