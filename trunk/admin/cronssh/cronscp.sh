# This script can copy files to or from a remote host without need 
# for login if the following asumptions are met:
# 1. Ordinary user
# 2. Desktop running currently running for that user
# 3. Desktop ran ssh-agent at startup
# 4. Desktop ran ssh-add shortly thereafter
# 5. Desktop ran our script, get-agent-data, shortly after that
#
# Because no password is needed, this script is convenient for use
# in scripts run from cron.
