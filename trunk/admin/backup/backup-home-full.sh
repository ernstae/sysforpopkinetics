# backup-home-full
#
# This script will backup up the home directory of a user on a 
# workstation to the directory $BACKDIR in that user's home
# directory on $RMTHOST. 
#
# The following assumptions are made:
# 1. The script is run by an ordinary user.  If it is scheduled by
#    cron, it must not be run by root.  In other words, use the
#    crontab -e  command to schedule this script.
# 2. The cronssh and cronscp scripts must be operational with respect
#    to the given $RMTHOST.
