  NAME
  spkjob -- drive the spk parallel protype
      
  SYNOPSIS
  spkjob job_id individual-count mode

  DESCRIPTION
  This program is the root process in the SPK parallel prototype.
  It runs on a parallel virtual machine (pvm), which is a set of linux
  computers clustered together by the pvm software.  It has
  responsibility for a single SPK job, including the initialization,
  logging messages, spawning the population level and cleanup. It
  always runs on the head node of the pvm.  It writes messages
  directly to the unified SPK log file, which is located on the same
  node. It assists descendant tasks, running on the same or different
  nodes, to write to the SPK log, by receiving their messages and
  copying them to that log.

  RUNNING
  In the production environment, the program that will be developed
  from this prototype, will be executed as the (unix) child process of
  the runtime daemon.  As a prototype, it can be run from the command
  line.  To assist in running the prototype from the command line,
  there is a script named newjob.sh in the same cvs directory as the
  rest of the source code.

  ACCESS PRIVILEGE
  Spkjob is designed to be run by an ordinary user rather than
  root. If root privilege were used to run spkjob on the head node,
  root privilege would also be required on all of the other nodes.
  This would be undesirable from a security point of view.  Instead,
  the ordinary user must be a member of the cspk group, which must
  exist on all nodes and have the same GID on all nodes.

  ARGUMENTS
  job_id is a whole number which is the key to the job table of the
  spkdb database, identifying the job to be run.  The prototype does
  not access the database, however, so this can be any number.  Each
  time that the prototype is run, spkjob creates a new working
  directory called "spkjob-nnn", where nnn is the job_id.  If that
  directory already exists, spkjob takes an error exit.  You should,
  therefore, either use a different job_id every time you run the
  prototype, or else remove the working directory each time.

  individual-count is the number of individuals being modeled.

  mode is either "test" or "prod" depending on whether the job is 
  running in the test environment or the production environment

  DESIGN CONSTRAINTS AND GOALS
  1. Any cluster management system can be used, as long as pvm
     is supported.
  2. Fault tolerance is required. The prototype must automatically
     handle the addition and deletion of nodes; it must terminate
     cleanly when any of the tasks is killed by the pvm console
     operator.
  3. Gnu C++ libraries are assumed.
  4. A distributed file system is required. NFS is satisfactory 
     in this regard.

  FILES
  The directory /usr/local/spk/share must be mounted on each node of
  the pvm. There are a number of distributed file systems that can be
  used for this, including the ancient but ubiquitous NFS, which is
  known not to handle write concurrency very well but is adequate for
  SPK, because it has been designed so that write concurrency is not
  required.

  /usr/local/spk/share/working/spkprod
    working directories for jobs run in the production environment
  /usr/local/spk/share/working/spktest
    working directories for jobs run in the test environment
  /usr/local/spk/share/log/spkprod/messages
    log file for the production environment
  /usr/local/spk/share/log/spktest/messages
    log file for the test environment
  /usr/local/spk/share/arch/i686/bin/spkprod
    production executables and libraries for i686 processor architecture
  /usr/local/spk/share/arch/i686/bin/spktest
    test executables and libraries for i686 processor architecture
  /usr/local/spk/share/arch/x86_64/bin/spkprod
    production executables and libraries for x86_64 processor architecture
  /usr/local/spk/share/arch/x86_64/bin/spktest
    test executables and libraries for x86_64 processor architecture
  ...

  BUGS 
  The code in this program assumes that when an event occurs, pvm
  sends event notice messages in the order notification requests were
  originally registered by calls to pvm_notify().  In particular, when
  the host on which spkpop is running is deleted, the PvmHostDelete
  message arrives before the PvmTaskExit message.  This behavior
  appears to be an undocumented implementation artifact.  If it
  changes in some future version of pvm, the message processing logic
  of this program will break.
