    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      Among RFPK's resources is a computational cluster which was
      purchased from Linux Labs at the end of the year 2001.
      With clustering software added to Linux operating system, the
      cluster has the potential of behaving towards software very much as would a 
      distributed memory multiprocessor system, except that 
      interprocess communication is accomplished via Ethernet
      rather than memory
      and, therefore, is many orders of magnitude slower. Spk, however,
      does not require high interprocess communication bandwidth.
    </para>
    <para>
      The cluster consists of five individual computers, interconnected
      by Ethernet.  The fact that each node is an individual machine
      increases the burden of system administration.  This document
      describes the configuration both of hardware and software so that
      it can be restored in case it is destroyed or degraded.
      It also provides some processes for operating the cluster.
    </para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Hardware</title>
    <sect2>
      <title>Node Description</title>
      <para>
	Each node of the cluster contains a Matsonic
	MS7308E mainboard, with a single 1GHz Pentium III processor,
	ethernet, video, keyboard, mouse and IDE disk interfaces.
      </para>
      <para>
	One node contains additional hardware so that it can act
	as a frontend or gateway for the other nodes. The host name
	of this node is &cspk1;, and it differs
	from the other nodes 
	the following ways:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      It has a second ethernet adapter.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      There is a combination drive, which contains both a floppy
	      drive and a CDROM drive.  The other nodes have DVD drives
	      capable of reading CDROMs, but no floppy.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      There are three PCI sockets, rather than the two which
	      are found on the other boards. The second ethernet 
	      adapter occupies one of these sockets. None of the
	      other PCI sockets of any of the nodes are used,
	      at present.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>
	The other nodes are named &cspk2;, ..., &cspk5; and
	are identical.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title id="invalid">Ethernet Adapter Bug</title>
      <para>
	All five nodes have an ethernet adapter chip on the mother
	board.  Each ethernet adapter should, according to IEEE
	standards, have a unique MAC address "burned into" the 
	hardware of the adapter.  The built-in adapters of all
	five nodes have identical MAC addresses, however.  As
	will be described
	<link linkend="fix">below</link>, a non-standard linux network
	configuration must be employed to work around this bug.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Node Interconnection</title>
      <para>
	At cluster is interconnected using one or the other of
	two topologies:
	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Frontend and computational nodes.  In this topology,
	      &cspk1; is connected to the green LAN via one of its
	      ethernet interfaces, and to the rest of the nodes
	      via its other ethernet interface and an ethernet
	      switch.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Each node is simply an individual computational
	      engine, connected to the green LAN.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
	Sometimes, the nodes are partitioned into two subsets,
	one set implementing the first topology and the other
	set implementing the second.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Keyboard, Video and Mouse</title>
      <para>
	On each node, the video connector is near the center of
	the back of the case.  The keyboard and mouse connectors
	are just to the right of the mainboard Ethernet socket,
	as viewed from the front.  These connectors are cabled
	to a KVM switch, so that all nodes are accessible,
	one at time, from a single keyboard, video monitor and
	mouse.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>BIOS</title>
      <para>
	The BIOS settings are the same for all nodes.  One of the
	quirks of these systems is that it can be difficult
	to get to the BIOS configuration screens. At the beginning
	of the boot sequence, the BIOS will instruct you to
	press <keycap>DEL</keycap> if you want to enter BIOS
	configuration.  Often you will be taken directly to the
	Grub boot screen even though you have pressed <keycap>DEL</keycap>.
	If this happens, press 
	<keycap>CTRL-ALT-DEL</keycap> to reboot, then continue
	to press <keycap>DEL</keycap> several times a second.  This 
	usually gets the attention of the BIOS.
      </para>
      <para>
	Small configuration changes need to be made at each of the
	following BIOS menu categories on all nodes:

	    The standard DHCP configuration created by the installation should
