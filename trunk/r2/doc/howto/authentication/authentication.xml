      <para>
	Due to the private nature of patient data and proprietary
	PK models, authentication and encryption are critical to
	the functioning of Spk.  This document provides specific
	directions for installing the required software infrastructure
	for the RFPK Spk demo system.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      The authentication and encryption infrastructure must achieve
      the following goals:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    A user logging into the web site must have confidence
	    that this is, indeed, the proper site and not an impostor.
   	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    All communication between Spk components that travels
	    over the public Internet must be encrypted.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The web server must have confidence that the client
	    application with which it is communicating is a valid
	    unmodified version of software released by RFPK.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      The first two goals are accomplished by configuring the web
      server to use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and by installing
      a validated authentication certificate.  
    </para>
    <para>
      Authentication is performed
      whenever a user selects a URL that starts with 
      "https://", indicating that the secure version of the
      http protocol is to used, the version that incorporates
      the Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
      In the process of establishing an SSL connection to the
      web server, the user's browser is sent a copy of the certificate
      by the server.  To be accepted, the certificate must have been
      digitally signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) whose
      signature and public encryption key
      are already on file within the browser.  Using this 
      encryption key, the browser deciphers the signature field
      in the certificate, and if the answer is indeed the 
      expected signature of the CA, the connection process goes
      forward.
    </para>
    <para>
      Over an SSL connection, every message is encrypted, in
      either direction. A 128-bit cipher is used, providing
      the measure of security that is now standard for the
      best commercial web sites.
    </para>
    <para>
      The third goal is accomplished by the Java WebStart technology
      used to distribute new and updated versions the Spk client,
      called the MDA. The MDA itself is digitally signed by the
      RFPK software team.  WebStart is configured so that only
      properly signed software will run.
    </para>

    <title>Good Housekeeping</title>
    <para>
      We will start by creating a file to hold our certificates, certificate
      request, and our certificate password.  Not everyone will agree that
      it is a good idea to keep a plain text version of the password in 
      a file, but here is the reasoning:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The certificate is worthless if the password is forgotten.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The password must be provided to the tomcat webserver as 
	    an argument, each time it starts up. In order for tomcat
	    to start automatically when the computer reboots, it is
	    necessary to place the password, in plain text, in a
	    configuration file called <filename>server.xml</filename>.
	    Unless the server is always started manually, there is
	    no way to avoid storing the password, somewhere, in 
	    plain text.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Since we must store the password in plain text, the important
	    thing is to be careful with file access permissions on the
	    files in which we store it.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      Let's get started, then:
      <screen>
su -
mkdir cert
chmod 750 cert
cd cert
      </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
	Next think up a very good password.  Store a copy of it in a file
	called password, so that it will not be forgotten:
      <screen>
echo 'Make@!This&*Good' > password
chmod 440 password
      </screen>
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Obtaining a Certificate</title>
    <para>
      A certificate must be signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).
      The best known CAs, including Verisign, Thawte, GeoTrust,
      provide this service for a fee.  They are respected and 
      have been in the business long enough that most browsers
      come with copies of their root certificates 
      pre-installed. Any certificate sold by one of these 
      well-known CAs will be derivative of one or another of
      these pre-installed root certificates and, hence, will
      be accepted automatically by 99% of the browsers, without
      requiring any user feedback.
    </para>
    <para>
      The University of Washington (UW) is a CA. In fact, any one
      can self-sign a certificate and hence act as a CA.  A
      certificate signed by the University of Washington is 
      apt to accepted by a broader spectrum of users than one
      signed by Alan Westhagen, Jiaji Du, or even RFPK. 
      The UW root certificate is not,
      however, pre-installed in browsers.  To access secure
      services at the UW, users are asked to 
      <ulink url="https://www.washington.edu/computing/ca/index.html">
	install the UW Services Certificate
      </ulink>,
      which can done automatically, with a button click, with most
      browsers.
    </para>
    <para>
      The following sections will describe the process for obtaining
      a certificate from the University of Washington CA. The first
      step will be to generate a public/private key pair. Once
      you have these keys, you will generate a properly formatted
      Certificate Signing Request which will be needed by the
      CA.  You will then be ready to use the semi-automated 
      process on a UW Computing and Communications for placing
      a request to have a certificate generated.  Finally you
      will, if all goes well, retrieve the certificate.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="password">
      <title>Generate a Public and a Private Key</title>
      <para>
	The first step is to produce a randomly generated
	public/private encryption key pair.  The keys are placed
	in a binary file called <filename>.keystore</filename>
        in the caller, i.e. root, home directory by default, which
        is the place we want to keep it in.  Tomcat servers
        require RSA encyription algorithm and look for an entry
        in <filename>.keystore</filename> named <literal>tomcat</literal>.
	<screen>
su -
$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA
	</screen>
      </para>
      <para>
	You will be asked to provide a password.  Make it a good one,
	because this password will provide access to the key pair that
	you are about to generate.
      </para>
      <para>
	The <command>keytool</command> program will ask you a number of
	questions. It is most important that you provide a good password
	when requested, because this will protect secrecy of your
	public/private key pair.  Be certain, as well, to provide the
	full domain name of the server, rather than your own first
	and last name.
      </para>
      <para>
	Here is the list of questions and suggested responses.
	The questions are in 
	<emphasis>italics</emphasis> and the responses in normal text.
	In response to the last question, simply press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.
	<screen>
<emphasis>Enter keystore password:</emphasis> Make@!This&*Good

<emphasis>What is your first and last name?
    [Unknown]:</emphasis> spk.rfpk.washington.edu

      <title>Generate a Certificate Signing Request</title>
      <para>
	Now that you have your keys, you can generate a CSR.
	<screen>
cd cert
$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -certreq -keyalg RSA -alias tomcat -file certreq.csr
	</screen>
      </para>
      <para>
	The resulting text file, <filename>certreq.csr</filename>, will look 
	something like this:

	that partially automates the process of obtaining a certificate.
	To use it, you must have a MyNetId weblogin.  You must

	administrators for the server for which you are obtaining
	a certificate. If you are not sure whether or not you are
	in the system administrator list, start the process anyway,
	because checking the DNS record and adding you, if necessary,
	is one of the steps that will follow.
      </para>
      <para>
	After providing information about the purpose of the certificate,
	you will be asked to paste a your CSR
	into a field in a form on the screen.
	In a terminal window, simply type
	<screen>
cat certreq.csr
	</screen>
	to display your CSR, use your left mouse button to high-light
	the text from the first - sign to the last, then cut and paste
	the high-lighted text into the browser window.  Finish the
	procedure at the web site, and then wait until your request
	is processed.  If everything works correctly, you should 
	receive email notification that your signed certificate is
