To install the System for Population Kinetics, please run the
installer script, which requires a working version of Perl.

As root,

   ./install

You could also run sudo ./install as your unprivileged user.

Expect this to take approximately 30 to 90 minutes, depending on
the speed of your computer.

After completing the install of all the runtime components for SPK,
please ensure you have a Sun Java JDK installed, and go to the 

       java-components

directory and read the README file for instructions on building
and installing the SPK java components.
