     <para>
       SPK Compiler, <filename>spkcompiler</filename>, is a command line application
       that takes two input files as arguments: an 
       <ulink url="http://192.168.2.2:8080/soft/v0.1/specs/sourceML/sourceML.html">
       SpkSourceML</ulink> document and an 
       <ulink url="http://192.168.2.2:8080/soft/v0.1/specs/dataML/dataML.html">SpkDataML</ulink>
       document.  
       The <ulink url="http://192.168.2.2:8080/soft/v0.1/specs/sourceML/sourceML.html">
       SpkSourceML</ulink> document contains control parameters and model definitions.
       The <ulink url="http://192.168.2.2:8080/soft/v0.1/specs/dataML/dataML.html">SpkDataML</ulink>
       document contains a data set.
       The system analyzes the two input files and generates a number of C++ source 
       code files that are, as together, built as an SPK job application.

     <title>Two Levels of Compilation</title>
     <para>SPK Compiler is composed of two layers of compilation
     facilities.  The outer one analyzes the input XML files and
     calls for the inner one which is specialized to analyze
     user's expression language, and then generates C++ source code.
     </para>
     <para>
     The system maintains a symbol table and other internal
     data structures.
     <ulink url="html/classSymbolTable.html">The symbol table</ulink>
     collects information about
     symbols that are found in the input XML files,
     user's model definitions, user's reserved words
     and system reserved keywords.  Other structures
     are maintained to hold any other information that
     may not fit well into the symbol table's structure or
     different representations of the same data found in
     the symbol table for convenience.
     </para>
     <para>
     The process is clearly staged into two:
        <orderedlist>
           <listitem>
             <para>Data Collection Stage</para>
             <para>
             In the first phase of compilation, the system focuses solely
             on collecting and assembling information in the symbol table
             and other internal data structures from the input.
	     During this stage, the internal data structures including
             the symbol table are read-write.  The XML parse trees
             may also be altered during this stage.
             </para>
           </listitem>
           <listitem>
	     <para>Code Generation Stage</para>
             <para>
             In the second phase, the system uses the collected information 
             and produce a number of C++ source code files and a Makefile. 
             All information should have been collected by now.  
             So, the XML parse trees should have no use in this stage. 
             The internal data structures including the symbol table
             are treated as read-only in this stage.
	     </para>
           </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
     </para>
     <sect2>
        <title>Outer: Analyzing XML Input Files and Generating C++
        </title>
        <para>
        The outer compiler performs overall semantic analysis of
        the SpkSourceML and SpkDataML documents and generates C++ 
        source code files.  It uses 
        Xerces-C++ DOM facility for lexical analysis and 
        as the parse tree generator.  We use DOM (i.e. tree generator)
        because information necessary to determine a piece of code
        may be scattered around in multiple places.  There are
        times also that directly inserting/removing information
        into or from the input structure simplifies the rest of
        the process.  For example, if a data set (represented
        by an SpkDataML document) were missing items that 
        are assumed to have certain default values, inserting
        the missing item with the default value
        in the earlier in the process allows
        the rest of the process to proceed without checking its
        existence.
        </para>
        <para>Within the SpkSourceML document
        is user's code that are written in 
        their specific expression language (ex. NONMEM Abbribiated Code).
        When the outer compiler reaches these code,
        it passes them to the inner compiler for further analysis.
        </para>
        <para>
        When all necessary information are gathered, the outer
        layer moves to the code-generation stage.
        For detailed discussion of generated code, see 
        <ulink url="#AEN68">Generated C++ Code</ulink>.
        </para>
     </sect2>
     <sect2>
        <title>Inner: Analyzing Expressions</title>
        <para>
        When the outer compiler reaches the user expression language,
        it passes them to the inner compiler, Expression Lanuage Compiler,
        for further analysis.  For example, NONMEM users use 
        NONMEM Abbribiated Code that follows the syntax of FORTRAN to
        define models.
        </para>
        <para>
        The purpose of this portion of compilation process is to gather
        enough information about symbols appearing in the expressions
        so that the system can ultimately generate a complete
        C++ application.  This can be tricky because symbols may 
        appear without formal declaration.  Certain characterics
        such as data type (ex. double for numerical variables)
        are applied per user-type basis.
