    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      MySQL is a relational database management system that is available
      under an open source GPL license when included as a part of an
      application that also bears an open source license. Because Spk is
      distributed as open souce, this powerful
      tool can be distributed as part of Spk at no cost to users.
    </para>
    <para>
      Spk requires the ability to make updates to the database as
      <emphasis>atomic transactions.</emphasis>.  This feature was
      first available in Version 4 of MySQL. An Spk installation
      should, therefore, install MySQL Version 4.0 or later.
    </para>
    <para>
      This document describes how to install, configure, and 
      manage MySQL as part of Spk.

    <title>Installing MySQL</title>
    <para>
      The following installation instructions are specific to 
      RPFK and RedHat Enterprise Linux version 3 (RHEL).
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Installing the Software</title>
      <para>
	The preferred way to install software in an RHEL system is with 
	packages assembled for installation using the <command>rpm</command>
	command (Redhat Package Manager).  Files for <command>rpm</command>,
	which can be identified by the <filename>.rpm</filename> filename
	suffix, are available for MySQL at the 
	<ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</ulink> web site.  The needed
	files, however, have already been downloaded, and are available on
	<filename>whitechuck.rfpk.washington.edu</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
	In a terminal window:
	<screen>
scp whitechuck:/opt/download/mysql.tar
tar xvf mysql.tar
su
cd mysql
rpm -Uhv *
	</screen>
      </para>
      <para>
	After the set of command listed above have been executed, MySQL
	should be installed on your machine and the MySQL server should
	be running.  Furthermore, the server will start automatically
	each time that you boot your machine.
      </para>
    </sect2>

      <title>Adding the Root User</title>
      <para>
	As the first step toward using your MySQL database, you must
	provide the MySQL root user with a password.  The MySQL 
	root user is not the same as the Linux root user, and should
	have a different password, because these two users have different
	roles and responsibilities.  
      </para>
      <para>
	In the following, assume that the password is 
	<emphasis>secret-code</emphasis>. Be certain, however, that you do
	not actually use <emphasis>secret-code</emphasis> as your password,
	but rather provide a string of alphabetic characters, digits, and
	special characters that is very difficult to guess.
      </para>
      <para>
	From a terminal window:
	<screen>
su 
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password <emphasis>secret-code</emphasis>
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h $HOSTNAME password <emphasis>secret-code</emphasis>
	</screen>
      </para>
