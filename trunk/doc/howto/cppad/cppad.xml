      This document demonstrates how to install/update CppAD for SPK
      that is different from the procedure given by the author of 
      the package.  Our procedure enables us to treat CppAD
      as part of SPK so that it is installed into our test environment
      first.

    <title>Installation (specific to SPK)</title>
    <para>
    If we follow the original author's installation procedure, CppAD is 
    installed in the following directories:
    <screen>
    headers      - $PREFIX/include/CppAD/
    libraries    - $PREFIX/lib/
    </screen>
    $PREFIX is an arbitrary path.
    </para>
    <para>
    On the other hand, SPK components installation requires the following
    directory structures:
    <screen>
    headers      - $PREFIX/include/$INST_ENV/CppAD/
    libraries    - $PREFIX/lib/$INST_ENV/
    </screen>
    $INST_ENV is either "spktest" for the test environment or
    "spkprod" for the production environment.
    </para>
    <para>
    We like to install CppAD just like other SPK components so that
    we can test fully under the test environment and move it to
    the production when it is really ready.  To do that, we ignore 
    the author's installation procedure and follow the procedure below:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
        Download a copy of CppAD (CppAD.unix.tar.gz) from 
        <ulink url="http://www.seanet.com/~bradbell">
        http://www.seanet.com/~bradbell</ulink> into /tmp on the
        installation machine.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
        Unpack the downloaded package:
        <screen>
  cd /tmp
  tar xvzf CppAD.unix.tar.gz
        </screen>
        This will extract files into a new directory 
        whose name begins with "cppad" followed by a release date/version.
        We denote it as "cppadXXX" for the rest of the document.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
        Create Makefiles tuned to the installation machine:
        <screen>
        cd cppadXXX
        ./configure
        </screen>
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
        Build the package:
        <screen>
        make
        </screen>
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
        We copy the headers along with its containing directory into
        /usr/local/include/spktest/:
        <screen>
        su
        cp -r CppAD /usr/local/include/spktest/CppAD
        </screen>
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
        Finally copy the library, libCppAD.a, to /usr/local/lib/spktest/:
        <screen>
        cp lib/lib* /usr/local/lib/spktest/
        </screen>
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </sect1>
