    <title>Purchase RHN Subscriptions</title>
    <para>
      Each Linux machine must have a subscription
      to the RedHat Network (RHN) update service.  It does not matter whether
      the machine is used as a developer workstation or as a server.  
      RFPK uses <emphasis>RedHat Enterprise Linux Academic 
	Server Edition</emphasis> for all Linux machines.
    </para>
    <para>
      When adding a new 
      Linux computer the the set already in use at RFPK, it is much easier
      if the subscription for it is purchased before Linux is installed.
      RedHat has designed its installation process so that the first time
      the system is booted after all the software has been loaded, 
      additional configuration information is requested, including the
      account name for the RHN subscription.
    </para>
    <para>
      RedHat provides academic pricing, which costs much less than the 
      standard pricing.  The RedHat
      <ulink url="http://www.redhat.com/solutions/industries/education/products/">
	academic products
      </ulink>
      website is unclear about whether or not computers owned by the university,
      as opposed to those owned by students, faculty or staff, are eligible for
      this favorable pricing.  Ben Freeman, the RedHat sales representative 
      assigned to the educational industry group, affirm, however, that RFPK
      owned machines are eligible.
    </para>

      To get academic pricing on a new subscription, and to have that subscription
      added to the account that we already have, is a bit tricky. If you

    <title>Renew RHN Subscriptions</title>
    <para>
      A month or two in advance of the expiration of an RHN subscription, you will
      receive email from RHN encouraging you to renew.  The message contains a
      link to the renewal web site.  It is best to renew immediately, especially
      if the subscription is for the workstation (WS) edition.  The academic
      price of WS is $25, but it is not offered anymore, except for renewals.
      If you allow the subscription to expire, you will have to purchase an
      academic server (AS) subcription for $50. Even when you renew several
      months in advance of expiration, your credit card will not be charged 
      until the old subscription expires and the new subscription goes into
      effect.

    <title>Install Linux on Additional Machines</title>
    <para>
      All of the workstations and servers in the RFPK Linux network run the same
      version of RedHat Enterprise Linux.  There are two different variants of this,
      however, one for each of the two processor architectures in use. The
      Sun V20z, which acts as the cspkserver, has the AMD-64 architecture.  All the
      others have the standard architecture.  This section outlines the process
      for installing the software whenever another machine is added to the collection.

    <title>Keep Systems Up-To-Date</title>
    <para>
      Keeping all of the Linux systems up-to-date is important for reliability
      and security.  RHN provides a web-accessible utility for making this
      easy.  Go to the RHN site which reports on 
      <ulink url="https://rhn.redhat.com/network/systems/system_list/visible_to_user.pxt">
	Systems
      </ulink>
      and check the status of your systems at least once a week.
      If the status shows that any of the systems have errata available,
      click the names of these systems to see what the errata pertain to.  If there
      are no errata for the Linux kernel, everything can be updated automatically from
      the web.  Simply check-mark each of the systems that have errata outstanding,
      click the <guibutton>Manage</guibutton> button, and then schedule the updates
      to occur as soon as possible.
    </para>
    <para>
      On any machine which has errata that pertain to the Linux kernel, the
      update cannot be done from the web.  Instead, the command
      <command>up2date</command> must be run by root on each of the machines,
      and then the machines rebooted.  In the case of the 
      development workstations, each developer should do this himself or herself.
      Send email, requesting this.  You will need to update the servers individually.
      The easiest way to handle this is to log in as an ordinary user, using
      <command>ssh</command>, use <command>su</command> to become root,
      and then to run <command>up2date</command>.

	      There must be <emphasis>no Microsoft Windows</emphasis>
	      behind the firewall, due to the manner in which the &uw;

	      Windows to viruses and spyware.  Whenever administrators
	      in the &uw; Computing and Communications (C&amp;C)
	      department observe network traffic that indicates that a
	      subnetwork contains an infected computer, they shut the
	      entire subnetwork down, and only then attempt to
	      determine exactly which machine was misbehaving. The

	      well as the infected one, can be down for days,
	      completely disrupting the work of the
	      <quote>innocent</quote> bystanders.  This happened to
	      RFPK.  Only one Windows machine was infected, but all of
	      the Linux machines were placed off-line for days.  Our
	      current gateway architecture was implemented as a result
	      of that experience.  This is now even more important,

      <title>Maintain the IpCop Configuration</title>
      <para>
	IpCop is the software that enables the gateway computer to 
	act as a physical three-interface firewall.  It, in fact, a
	specialized version of Linux. The computer, which resides in 
	the far southwest corner of the lab, can be accessed via a 
	keyboard and monitor which are shared, by means of a kvm switch, with
	whitechuck and webserver.  It cannot be accessed using <command>ssh</command>
	because it is set up to forward any <command>ssh</command>
	connection to whitechuck.  By logging into the computer from
	the keyboard, you can perform Linux system administration.  This
	is almost never needed.
      </para>
      <para>
	The firewall features of IpCop are maintained via a set of
	administrative screens provided by a graphical user interface.
	This GUI is not accessible from the keyboard and monitor because,
	due to a mismatch between the graphics card in the gateway and
	that in whitechuck, a graphical desktop cannot be run on the
	gateway.  This is not a problem, however, because the
	IpCop configuration can be maintained via a
	<ulink url="https://192.168.1.1:445/cgi-bin/index.cgi">

	    first added to the network, a host receives its IP address and 
	    certain other network configuration parameters from the dhcp 
	    server.  This simplifies system administration.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    One side-effect of using a dhcp server is that the IP address can
	    change if a host is removed from the network and then later reconnected,
	    because the IP address may be reassigned to a different machine in the meantime.  
	    Processes in place at RFPK expect IP addresses not to change, however.
	    For example, the deployment script, <command>deploy_candidate.pl</command>,
	    copies files from aspkserver to cspkserver.  If the IP address of 
	    cspkserver were to change, the script would <quote>break</quote>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Dhcp has a feature called the <emphasis>lease</emphasis> which keeps
	    an IP address from being reassigned immediately.  A host has a lease
	    on an address for a fixed period of time: 120 minutes, for example.
	    If the lease time is made very long, the IP address becomes, in effect,
	    fixed
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    When a host that is configured to use dhcp is connected to the 
	    network, it needs to discover what IP address to use.  It sends
	    a message to the dhcp server containing a unique code
	    which distinguishes it from every other computer
	    in the universe.  The code that is used is the MAC address of the
	    ethernet card that the host is using for the communication.  The
	    ethernet standard requires every card to have a unique MAC address.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    When the dhcp server receives the MAC address from a host that is 
	    trying to discover its IP address, it first looks in a table to determine
	    whether or not that MAC address already has a lease on an IP.
	    If so, it sends the IP address back to the host; otherwise it creates
	    a new, temporary lease relating the MAC address with an IP address
	    that was currently unassigned.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The <guilabel>dhcp</guilabel> screen provides a simple
	    means for extending the time period of an existing lease
	    practically to infinity, effectively making it
	    <emphasis>fixed</emphasis>.  You simply enter the MAC
	    address and IP address of the lease in the fields
	    provided.

	    Here is the step-by-step procedure for adding a machine to the green network and
	    fixing its IP address:
	    <orderedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  Physically connect the machine with a green CAT-5 patch cable to one of
		  two Compex ethernet switches.
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  The machine should connect immediately to the internet.  Check this,
		  pinging a well-known site:
		  <screen>
ping mit.edu
		  </screen>
		  If this
		  does not work, you may have to restart the network 
		  <screen>
su
/etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart
		  </screen>
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  In a shell window, execute <command>/sbin/ifconfig</command> to 
		  determine what the MAC address of the ethernet card is and what
		  IP address has been temporarily assigned by the dhcp server.  The
		  information is in the entry titled <quote>eth0</quote>.  The
		  MAC address is referred to as <quote>HWaddr</quote> and the
		  IP address as <quote>inet addr</quote>. 
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>

		  In your browser, connect to the IpCop 
		  <ulink url="https://192.168.1.1:445/cgi-bin/index.cgi">

		  </ulink>.
		  Proceed to the <guilabel>Services</guilabel> screen and then
		  to the <guilabel>dhcp</guilabel> screen.
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  In the <guilabel>Add a new fixed lease</guilabel> section of the

		  ifconfig output in your shell window into the
		  <guilabel>MAC address</guilabel> and 
		  <guilabel>IP Address</guilabel> fields respectively.
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  Press the <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button to complete the

	  <title>Port Forwarding</title>
	  <para>
	    The gateway has the domain name &spkdn; and the IP address
	    128.95.35.85.  None of the hosts behind the firewall have
	    domain names or IP addresses that are
	    <emphasis>routable</emphasis> (i.e. usable) on the
	    internet. Instead, all requests for services are directed
	    to &spkdn; and then routed, using network address
	    translation (NAT), by the gateway to the particular server
	    that provides that service.  For example, all requests for
	    ssh or scp, are forwarded to whitechuck.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    To add an additional service to &spkdn; do the following:
	    <orderedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  Select a port number which is currently not being
		  used for any service at &spkdn;. 
		</para>
		<para>
		  Consider as an example, the problem of making the
		  annual report application, which runs on whitechuck
		  port 80, accessible via the web. Because
		  &spkdn;<filename>:80</filename> was already used for
		  spk, port 80 was not available for the annual
		  report.  Instead, we decided on the external address
		  of &spkdn;<filename>:8082</filename>, and configured
		  the gateway to transfer all requests directed to
		  that address into requests to port 80 on
		  whitechuck.
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  Determine the internal IP address of the server.
		  (One way to do this is to look at the
		  <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file on whitechuck).
		  In our example, the internal IP address was that of
		  whitechuck, which is
		  <filename>192.168.1.2</filename>.
		</para>
