    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This specification describes the logical design of the
      Spk database.  It complements two other specifications:

    <title>Architectural Context</title>
    <para>
      The Spk system architecture is comprised of three major 
      independent processes, each of which may have multiple
      instances running simultaneously.  The major processes
      are the following:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para> 
	    <emphasis>MDA Surrogate.</emphasis>
	    The Model Design Agent is a client application which
	    runs on the user's workstation.  There will typically
	    be many MDAs in operation at any given time.  Each
	    MDA communicates with the rest of Spk via a secure
	    Internet connection to a web server.  The portion of
	    the web server which supports the MDA is called 
	    the MDA Surrogate.  For performance reasons, the
	    architecture permits multiple MDA Surrogates to 
	    be running simultaneously on one or more server
	    machines.  
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Aspk Compiler</emphasis>.  The Application
	    Server for Population Kinetics is a specialized compiler
	    which translates model specifications received from 
	    MDAs into C++ source code to be compiled and linked
	    into object code and then run by the Cspk. To 
	    optimize performance, there can be multiple Aspk
	    Compilers running simultaneously on one or more
	    server machines.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Cspk</emphasis>.  The Computational Server
	    for Population Kinetics receives source code for a
	    model along with scientific
	    data from the Aspk, utilizes a C++ compiler and linker
	    to build a representation of the model in object code,
	    and then executes it.  There can be multiple
	    Cspk server machines and processor clusters.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      These three tasks run continuously and, hence, are
      the type of processes known as <emphasis>daemons</emphasis>.
      A daemon is implemented and installed in such a way that
      it starts automatically when the host computer on 
      which it runs is booted up, and it stops gracefully when
      the machine is shut down.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Spk database is <emphasis>the sole means of communication</emphasis>
      between these daemons. It plays, 
      therefore, a central role in the Spk architecture.  The principal
      interprocess communications are the following:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>MDA Surrogate to Aspk Compiler</emphasis>.
	    The MDA submits a user job, via the Surrogate,
	    by creating a new row
	    in the <emphasis>job</emphasis> table, storing
	    the model in the <emphasis>xml_source</emphasis> field,
	    the data in the <emphasis>xml_data</emphasis> field,
	    the user's identification number in the
	    <emphasis>user_id</emphasis> field, and
	    setting the <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> field to
	    "Queued to Compile".
	    The Aspk Compiler 
	    selects the job from the queue when it has become the highest
	    priority job with "Queued to Compile" status,
	    retrieving the model and data and setting 
	    <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to "Compiling".
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Aspk Compiler to MDA</emphasis>. If, for any 
	    reason, the compilation process fails, the Aspk Compiler
	    stores an error report in the
	    <emphasis>report</emphasis> field of the 
	    job, sets <emphasis>state_code </emphasis> to "End"
	    and <emphasis>end_code</emphasis>
	    to "Compilation Error".  When querying the database,
	    an MDA Surrogate notices that one of its jobs has reached the
	    "End" state and retrieves the report from the database.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Aspk Compiler to Cspk</emphasis>.  If the model
	    compiles successfully, the Aspk Compiler stores
	    an archive of C++ source code and data into the 
	    <emphasis>cpp_source</emphasis> field of the job
	    and sets <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to "Queued to Run".
	    A Cspk selects the job when it is the job of highest
	    priority in the "Queued to Run" state, retrieving 
	    the source code and data and setting 
	    <emphasis>state_code</emphasis> to "Running".
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Cspk to MDA Surrogate</emphasis>.  
	    When the model runs to completion, the Cspk stores
	    the final report in the <emphasis>report</emphasis>
	    field of the job, sets <emphasis>state_code</emphasis>
	    to "End" and <emphasis>end_code</emphasis> to
	    "Successful Run".  When an MDA Surrogate notices that one of
	    its jobs had reached the "End" state, 
	    it retrieves the final report.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
     </para>
    <para>
      Several very important points must be emphasized:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    All the high-level interprocess communication described
	    above is <emphasis>asynchronous</emphasis>. The loose
	    coupling between the daemons is very attractive from
	    an operational standpoint because additional instances
	    of the daemons can be easily added or subtracted at
	    any time.  There is a slight penalty to be paid in 
	    terms of communications latency, but this is negligible
	    given the low activity level in the queues.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Multiple processes may be updating the 
	    <emphasis>job</emphasis> table simultaneously. 
	    These updates must be <emphasis>atomic</emphasis>
	    transactions.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Transaction Processing Considerations</title>
    <para>
      In general, multiple independent processes will be modifying
      the database simultaneously. In designing the database, it is
      imperative to anticipate situations in which two processes,
      attempting to do the same thing at the same time, could damage
      database logical integrity.
    </para>
    <para>
      As an example, consider the selection of the highest priority
      job from the compiler queue.  There may be several copies
      of the Aspk Compiler running concurrently, and two of these
      might attempt to a job from the queue simultaneously.
      The selection of a job entails the following:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Select from the <emphasis>job</emphasis>
	    table the job of highest priority
	    which has state_code = 'q2c'.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Change the state_code field from 'q2c' to 'cmp', to 
	    logically remove the job from the compiler queue.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      Both steps must occur as a single transaction, even though
      time might elapse in between.  If this constraint is not 
      enforced the following is one example of what might happen:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Compiler-1 selects the highest priority job.  
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Before Compiler-1 can change the state_code in the job,
	    compiler-2 selects the same job.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Both Compiler-1 and Compiler-2 compile the job and 
	    queue it to be run.  This is a waste of resources.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Since the job has been queued twice, it runs twice.  
	    This is a huge waste of resources and is very likely
	    to confuse the user.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      In Version 4 of MySQL, transaction support is provided for
      tables of type 'InnoDB'.  To avoid the problem described above,
      the <emphasis>job</emphasis> table must be created with with
      'InnoDB' type, and within programs, the steps required for
      removing a job from a queue occur between SQL <command>begin</command>
      and <command>end</command> statements.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the <link linkend="tables_and_fields">Tables and Fields</link> section,
      transaction processing considerations will be discussed for each table.
