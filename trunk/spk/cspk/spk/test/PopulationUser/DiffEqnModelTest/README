[ Installation ]

Required installations:
  * SPK Library
  * NAG Library


1. > ./autogen.sh

   This creates "configure.in" along with other things.  If this succeeds,
   forward to the next step.  If fails, check the versions of automake
   and libtool.  Update the packages if necessarily and come back to
   this step.

2. > ./configure

   This creates "Makefile"s recursively.

3. > ./make

   If any of the required installations were missing, this would fail.

4. > cd src

5. > ./DiffEqnModelTest

   If this complains about NAG Library, the chances are, you have not
   updated their license keys.  Go to:
  
   http://whitechuck.rfpk.washington.edu/soft/howto/nag-install/nag-install.html

   to obtain the latest license keys and follow the instruction to update.

   Also note that, by default, the Makefile that builds this executable
   links to a version of driver that is meant to be driven by a Perl script.
   If you want a standalone driver, consult with
   Sachiko (honda99@u.washington.edu).
