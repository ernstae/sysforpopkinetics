dnl <AC_CONFIG_FILES>
dnl
dnl Make AC_OUTPUT create each 'file' by copying an input file (by default 'file.in')
dnl substituing the output variable values.

dnl
dnl <AC_OUTPUT>
dnl
dnl Generate 'config.status' and launch it.  Call this macro once at the end
dnl of 'configure.ac'.
dnl 'config.status' will perform all the configuration actions;
dnl all the output files, header files, comands, links, subdirectories
dnl to configure are hornored.
dnl
dnl The location of AC_OUTPUT invocation is the exact point where
dnl configuration actions are taken; any code afterwards will be executed
dnl by configure once config.status was run.
