<Dependencies>
The library requires ATLAS LAPACK and CBLAS.  The instructions to find
or install these libraries can be found in RFPK Software Group's internal
website.

It also requires Xerces-C for the XML parser being used by the compiler library
components.  Get the source distribution of xerces-c-2.5 from
http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/install.html and build/install according to the
instructions given in http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/build-misc.html#RPMLinux.

The test suites require CppUnit.  Likewise, the instructions can be found
in the group's website.

To build the documentations, you need JAVAC, which can be found in the SUN site.

<How To Build and Install SPK Compiler>

1. Assuming you're currently in the top level directory, "spkcompiler",
   run a shell script that generates the configure script.

   > ./autogen.sh

2. Run the generated configure script:

   > ./configure

3. If everything goes well, Makefiles should have been created in 
   subsequent subdirectories.  Change the directory and invoke "make"
   as follows:
   
   > cd spkcompiler
   > make

4. To install the libraries, you must become super-user:

   > su

   Then, type the following:

   > make install
   > exit

   This will install "spkcompiler" into /usr/local/bin/spktest/.

<How To Build/Run the Tests>

The unit tests require CppUnit.  If you do not have CppUnit installed on your machine, this is the time to do so.  You can find it at www.sourceforge.net and the installation procedure is posted in RFPK Software Group's internal website.

1. Move to the top directory and then to "tests".

2. Type:

   > make

3. Two sets of test are built in "tests/common" and "tests/nonmem" directories.
   Run "testall" in each directory.  

DONE.
