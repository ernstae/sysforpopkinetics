	    <h3>SPK -- The System for Population Kinetics</h3>
	    <p> 
	      Welcome to the home of SPK, the System for Population Kinetics.  Spk 
	      is being developed by the Resource for Population Kinetics (RFPK), in the
	      Bioengineering Department of University of Washington, with partial
	      support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), under grant
	      P41 EB-001975. The software will be released under an Open Source License.
	    </p>
	    <h3>About Our University of Washington Certificate</h3>
	    <p>
	      This web site is hosted on a secure web server. When you first attempted 
	      to access this page, you may have been greeted by a pop-up window warning
              you that the security of the web site was suspect. The reason for this
	      lack of trust 
	      is that our server certificate was issued by the University of Washington
	      Certificate Authority rather than one of the commercial certificate 
              authorities known to your browser.
	    </p>
            <p>
	      If you intend to be a repeat user of spk.rfpk.washington.edu, we recommend
	      that you import the University of Washington <em>root</em> certificate
              into your browser. The process takes only a few seconds.
	      After that has been accomplished, your browser will
	      greet all certificates issued by the University of Washington 
	      Certificate Authority, and ours in particular, with the same degree of
	      cordiality that it extends to commercial ones.
            </p>
            <p>
	      The University of Washington root certificate can be installed
              <a href="https://www.washington.edu/computing/ca/index.html">here</a>.
