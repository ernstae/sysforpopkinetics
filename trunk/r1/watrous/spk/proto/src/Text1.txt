/xOut/
/$$
The $xref/glossary/Output Value/output value/$$ of $italic xOut$$
is a double-precision column vector containing the approximate
maximizer of the population optimal design criterion.








$syntax/

/alpStep/
/$$
The double-precision column vector $italic alpStep$$
specifies the step size used for approximating
the derivatives with respect to the fixed population parameters.
$syntax/

/alpLow/
/$$
is a double-precision column vector with the same length as $italic alpIn$$
specifying the lower limit for $italic alp$$ during the optimization.
$syntax/

/alpUp/
/$$
is a double-precision column vector with the same length as $italic alpIn$$
specifying the upper limit for $italic alp$$ during the optimization.
$syntax/

/alpIn/
/$$
is a double-precision column vector specifying the initial value
for the fixed population parameters.
The $xref/glossary/Ordering Of Vectors/order condition/$$
$math%alpLow \le alpIn \le alpUp%$$ is assumed to hold.
$syntax/

/alpOut/
/$$
The $xref/glossary/Output Value/output value/$$ of $italic alpOut$$
is a double-precision column vector containing the approximate
minimizer of the negative logarithm of the integrand that appears 
in the population expected determinant optimal design criterion
as a function of the fixed population parameters.
This is under the assumption that $italic xOut$$
is the true value for the design parameters.
The values $math%eps(1)%$$, and $math%delta(1)%$$, are used 
for accepting the minimizers with respect to the fixed population parameters.
