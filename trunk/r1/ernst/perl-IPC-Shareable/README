This code was fixed because it would not install properly.

Changing line 455

    $#{@{$self->{_data}}} = $n - 1;
[download]
into

    $#{$self->{_data}} = $n - 1;
[download]
fixes the issue for me.

(modify blib/lib/IPC/Sharable.pm in the build directory before running the tests with make test)

This problem was reported two years ago. It looks like this module isn't being maintained.

Some background for those interested:

There was a bug in Perl such that

$#{ @array }
[download]
was interpreted as

$#{ \@array }
[download]
instead of
$#{ scalar(@array) }
[download]
IPC::Shareable's test relies on this bug, but it was fixed in Perl 5.10. Note the lack of 5.10.x and 5.12.x passing results.
