	    <h3>Instructions for Installing JRE on MAC</h3>
	    <p> 
              <h4>Under Tiger (10.4.x)</h4>
- If your computer is configured to automatically download software updates from Apple, you should automatically have the J2SE 5.0 version of the Java Virtual Machine installed on your system.  If you are unsure, you may click on the Apple menu, and choose "Software Update".<br><br>
- The Software Update application will load and check for updates to your system, and if "Java Runtime Environment" is not on the list of software requiring updates, it is already installed on your computer.<br><br>
- If it appears on the list of software to update, proceed with the update.  Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) 5.0 Release 4 delivers improved reliability and compatibility for Java 2 Platform Standard Edition 5.0 on Mac OS X v10.4.5 and later. With this update J2SE 5.0 becomes the preferred Java version, superseding Java 1.4.2.<br><br>
- Please note that separate downloads exist for PowerPC-based and Intel-based Macintosh computers.
            </p><p>                                          
<h4>Under Panther (10.3.x)</h4>
- The SPK system has not been tested under Mac OS X 10.3.x (Panther).<br><br>
- However, users should be able to install the J2SE 5.0 from http://developer.apple.com/java/download.  Once installed, you will have two versions of the Java Runtime Environment on your computer (version 1.4.2 shipped with the operating system). 
            </p><p>
                  Note that the JRE version number may be different in the future.
