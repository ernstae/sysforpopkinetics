1: <Dependencies>
The library requires ATLAS LAPACK and CBLAS.  The instructions to find
or install these libraries can be found in RFPK Software Group's internal
website.

It also requires Xerces-C for the XML parser being used by the compiler library
components.  Get the source distribution of xerces-c-2.5 from
http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/install.html and build/install according to the
instructions given in http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/build-misc.html#RPMLinux.

The test suites require CppUnit.  Likewise, the instructions can be found
in the group's website.

To build the documentations, you need JAVAC, which can be found in the SUN site.

3: <How To Build and Install SPK Compiler>

3-1. Assuming you're currently in the top level directory, "spkcompiler",
   run a shell script that generates the configure script.

   > ./autogen.sh

3-2. Run the generated configure script:

   > ./configure

3-3. If everything goes well, Makefiles should have been created in 
   subsequent subdirectories.  
   
   > make

3-4. Install the compiler:

   > su
   > make install
   > exit

   This will install "spkcompiler" into /usr/local/bin/spktest/.

4: <How To Run the Tests>

   > cd tests
   > cd common
   > ./testall
   > ../nonmem
   > ./testall

DONE.
