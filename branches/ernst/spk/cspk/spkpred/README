<How to build the SPK PRED Library & tests>

1. In the directory where this README is found, run "autogen.sh" without
any argument for building the debug version (i.e. debug info and 
no code optimization) or with "--enable-release-build" for the release version.

  For debug...
   > .autogen.sh

  For release...
   > .autogen.sh --enable-release-build

This is a bootstrap script that generates and run "configure".
By the end, all necessary Makefile's are generated in subsequent
directories.

2. Run make in the current directory to build the library, the tests
and the documentation:

   > make

NOTE: the Makefile in ./doc directory assumes "omehelp" is in 
an (executable) searching path (e.x. /usr/local/bin).


<Run unit tests>

1. Change directory to ./test/unit/src/ and run "testall":

   > cd test/unit/src
   > ./testall

This should display a number of dots and some matrices.  If something
goes wrong, it should display messages containing a text "fail".


<Installation>

1. Change directory to where README is found.  If you are continuing
from the previous section (i.e. running unit tests), type:

   > cd ../../../

2. Change directory to "spk":

   > cd spk

3. Get the root privilege and run "make install":

   > su 
   > make install

This will install the SPK PRED library into /usr/local/lib/spktest/
and the header files into /usr/local/include/spktest/.
