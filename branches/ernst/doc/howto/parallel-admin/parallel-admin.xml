	Virtual Machine (pvm). This document describes the system
	administration of SPK in the pvm environment. It is a

    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      The principal unit of work in SPK is called a job.  It is created by
      a user when, with the help of a graphical tool called the MDA, she
      combines a model with data and various parameters and submits it
      via the internet for processing.
    </para>
    <para>
      Before the job can begin its 
      computational phase, it first travels to a server known as
      the Application Server for Population Kinetics
      <emphasis>(aspkserver)</emphasis>, where it is compiled 
      by the ASPK compiler to create three C++ programs, called 
      <emphasis>spkjob</emphasis>, 
      <emphasis>spkpop</emphasis> and <emphasis>spkind</emphasis>.
      The job is then queued for execution.
    </para>
    <para>
      The next step in the history of the job is to be selected for
      processing on a group of computers harnessed for 
      parallel computation by software called the Parallel Virtual
      Machine (pvm). We refer to each of these computers as
      a <emphasis>node</emphasis> or a <emphasis>host</emphasis>
      and to the collection of computers as the 
      <emphasis>cluster</emphasis> or the <emphasis>pvm</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      One node of the pvm is distinguished as the 
      <emphasis>head node</emphasis>.  In terms of the SPK architecture,
      this is the Computational Server for Population Kinetics
      <emphasis>(cspkserver)</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      On cspkserver, the three programs output by the ASPK
      compiler are further compiled and linked to the SPK library
      to create an executable binary for spkjob, for spkpop and
      for spkind.
    </para>
    <para>
      Spkjob is then executed on cspkserver itself. It utilizes pvm
      functions to spawn spkpop as a subtask.  Which node spkpop actually
      runs on is determined by load distribution algorithms in pvm.
    </para>
    <para>
      Spkpop then performs an iterative computation with the goal of
      generating the results specified by the user. With each 
      iteration, spkpop spawns <emphasis>n</emphasis> instances of
      spkind, where <emphasis>n</emphasis> is the number of individuals
      in the population being modeled. Which node a particular 
      spkind runs on is determined by pvm.
    </para>
    <para>
      Spkjob, spkpop, and the <emphasis>n</emphasis> instances of 
      spkind all run as independent processes, under the linux or
      unix operating system.  The parent process of spkjob is the
      SPK runtime daemon, which executes continuously on 
      cspkserver.  The parent process of spkpop is a pvm daemon
      running on the node to which it was assigned.  Similarly,
      each instance of spkind is the child of a pvm daemon running
      on its node.  
    </para>
    <para>
      On every unix or linux host, parent/child relationships
      create a single process hierarchy.  This hierarchy does not
      extend beyond that host, however, to other hosts in the cluster.
      With pvm, there is a second hierarchy, maintained by 
      communication between daemons, which does span the 
      boundaries between hosts. In pvm parlance the
      programs running in the hierarchy are referred to as
      <emphasis>tasks</emphasis> to distinguish these
      relationships from those between linux/unix
      <emphasis>processes</emphasis> and the hierarchy is the
      <emphasis>pvm task hierarchy</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      SPK uses two channels for inter-task communications:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>PVM message passing</emphasis>, using functions provided by a
	    pvm. This communication channel is used for pvm event messages
	    and application log messages.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Shared file hierarchy</emphasis>. The ubiquitous 
	    Network File System (NFS) works well for this purpose,
	    although nearly any other distributed file system 
	    can be used in its place. This communication channel is used
	    for the communication of application inputs and outputs.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      There is no system administration required for pvm message passing, beyond
      installation and configuration of pvm as described in
      <ulink url="../pvm-admin/pvm-admin.html">
	PVM Administration at RFPK
      </ulink>.  Spkjob and spkpop set up the message channels and pvm does the
      rest automatically.
    </para>
    <para>
      The shared file hierarchy is created and maintain entirely by linux/unix
      system administration functions.  Here are some of the features of the
      file hierarchy:
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The files actually reside on aspkserver, both because of its large
	    disk capacity and its tape backup system.  The aspkserver
	    uses NFS to <emphasis>export</emphasis> this hierarchy.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    All the nodes of the pvm <emphasis>mount</emphasis>
	    the file hierarchy as a filesystem
	    of type <emphasis>nfs</emphasis>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The directory tree looks like this:
