    <para>
	It is important that the system clocks in the Linux 
	workstations of the RFPK Software Team be closely 
	synchronized with the clock in the Linux server,
	<systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>,
	because the CVS application on that machine as well as the
	backup process depends on the comparison of timestamps on
	files residing on different machines.  This tutorial
	explains how to configure your workstation so that it
	stays synchronized within a fraction of a second with that on
 	<systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>.

    <title>Network Time Protocol</title>
    <para>
      The Network Time Protocol (NTP) allows computers connected
      to the Internet to keep their clocks synchronized.  Certain
      host computers equipped with accurate clocks make the NTP
      service available to other, less well endowed, hosts.  
      A machine with an accurate clock which is offering an NTP
      service is known as a <emphasis>level one</emphasis> NTP
      server.  Other machines, which may not be equipped with
      accurate clocks but which nevertheless have accurate time
      due to the fact that they are synchronized to one or more
      <emphasis>level one</emphasis> NTP servers, can offer an
      NTP service over the Internet as <emphasis>level two</emphasis>
      NTP servers, and so on.
    </para>
    <para>
      The host
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">
	bigben.cac.washington.edu
      </systemitem>
      is a <emphasis>level one</emphasis> NTP server equipped
      with a clock that gets its time from GPS satellites. 
      The RFPK Linux server,
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>,
      is synchronized to 
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">bigben</systemitem>
      and several other <emphasis>level one</emphasis> NTP servers.
      This document describes the way to configure your 
      RedHat Linux 8.0 workstation to synchronize to 
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are two reasons for synchronizing our workstations to
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>
      rather than to 
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">bigben</systemitem>:

	    Synchronize to the machine that we really want to be 
	    in sync with.  Even if
	    <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>
	    should go out of sync with the <emphasis>level one</emphasis>
	    servers because of Internet problems, for example, our CVS
	    and backup processes would still work well because they would be
	    comparing timestamps on files on our workstations with those on
	    <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>.

    <title>Configuring RFPK Software Development Workstations</title>
    <para>
      In this section, we will edit several configuration files. To do this, 
      you will need root privilege.
    </para>
    <para>
      We will start by putting the file
      <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/ntp.conf</filename> under local
      source control:
      <screen format="linespecific">
su -
cd /etc
ci -l ntp.conf
      </screen>
      Edit <filename>ntp.conf</filename>
      with your favorite editor, setting the default behavior to 
      <emphasis>nomodify</emphasis> rather than 
      <emphasis>ignore</emphasis>.
      <screen format="linespecific">
restrict default ignore

	<emphasis>should be changed to</emphasis>

restrict default nomodify
      </screen>
      Next specify that 
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>
      is a trusted time server by making this change:
      <screen format="linespecific">
	after

# restrict mytrustedtimeserverip mask 255.255.255.255 nomodify notap noquery
# server mytrustedtimeserverip

	insert the following pair of lines

restrict whitechuck.rfpk.washington.edu nomodify notrap noquery
server whitechuck
      </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      After making the above changes, use the <command moreinfo="none">rcsdiff</command>
      command to check your work:
      <screen format="linespecific">
rcsdiff ntp.conf
      </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      Finally, we need to recreate the 
      <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/ntp/step-tickers</filename> file,
      which is a list of time servers queried by your system when it boots.
    </para>
    <para>
      <screen format="linespecific">
cd /etc/ntp
echo whitechuck.rfpk.washington.edu > step-tickers
echo time.nist.gov >> step-tickers
      </screen>
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Daemon Setup</title>
    <para>
      We need to start the ntp daemon, if it is not already running, and
      make sure that it is started automatically whenever the system reboots.
      As <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="username">root</systemitem>,
      input the following commands:
      <screen format="linespecific">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/ntpd restart
chkconfig --level 2345 ntpd on
      </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      You should now check that your ntp daemon is working.
      Wait a few seconds after restarting ntpd, then issue this command:
      <screen format="linespecific">
ntpq -p
      </screen>
      You should see output that looks something like this:
      <screen format="linespecific">
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
 LOCAL(0)        LOCAL(0)        10 l   63   64  377    0.000    0.000   0.008

      </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      I believe that this
      shows that there are two time servers, the dummy local server to
      be used in case the network is down, and 
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>.
      It shows that 
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>
      gets its time from 
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">bigben</systemitem>,
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>
      is a level 2 server, it is remote, it was last queried 192 seconds ago,
      it is queried every 256 seconds, a measure of its estimated
      "reachability" is 377, there is a delay of 0.684 milli-seconds
      between the
      time it is queried and the time the response arrives, an offset of 
      0.075 milli-seconds was applied in order to synchronize
      the clocks and an 
      estimate of the random error is 0.024 milli-seconds.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you do not get comparable numbers (for example, the jitter is 0.000)
      there is something wrong.

    <title>Configuring the RFPK Time Server on Whitechuck</title>
    <para>
      The RFPK time server running on 
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>
      needs to be configured somewhat differently than those running on
      workstations.
    </para>
    <para>
      Just as for workstations,
      the default should be edited to read
      <screen>
restrict default nomodify
      </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      The list of trusted servers, should read as follows:
      <screen>
restrict bigben.cac.washington.edu nomodify notrap noquery
restrict time.nist.gov nomodify notrap noquery
restrict tick.uh.edu nomodify notrap noquery
restrict tick.usno.navy.mil nomodify notrap noquery

server bigben.cac.washington.edu
server time.nist.gov
server tick.uh.edu
server tick.usno.navy.mil
      </screen>
    </para>
    <para>
      Unlike the workstation case, the server must be opened to 
      clients.  Just following the commented CLIENT NETWORK
      section, add the following
      <screen>
restrict 128.95.35.0 mask 255.255.255.0 notrust nomodify notrap
      </screen>
      which enables service requests coming from any of the
      256 IP addresses starting 128.95.35, which is the range
      encompassing the IPs for workstations located in the 
      lab at AERL 241.  
    </para>
    <para>
      Additional lines, similar to the one above, can be added
      to accommodate RFPK machines with IP addresses that fall
      into other address ranges.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Configuring Time Service for the Cluster</title>
    <para>
      The gateway node should be configured to be the same as
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">whitechuck</systemitem>,
      except that 
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">
	bigben.cac.washington.edu
      </systemitem>
      should be replaced by
      <systemitem moreinfo="none" class="systemname">
	whitechuck.rfpk.washington.edu
      </systemitem> 
      and the range of client IP addresses should be
      "192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0".
    </para>
    <para>
      Each of the other nodes should be configured as workstations,
      except that the trusted server specification should be the
      following:
      <screen>
restrict 192.168.1.1 mask 255.255.255.255 nomodify notrap noquery
server 192.168.1.1
      </screen>
    </para>
