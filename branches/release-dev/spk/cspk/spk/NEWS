January 2008 marks the first public release of SPK as an installable
product for users who would like to create their own Service for 
Population Kinetics.

As such, please be aware that the installed user base is quite small
and while we have tried to streamline the install process, we would like
to solicit requests for improvement, and wherever possible, code contributions
to help the install of SPK to be as seamless on operating systems other than
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (3,4,5) and Fedora (tested: 5,6,7,8)

Please feel free to make requests to our developers via e-mail at spk-dev@rfpk.washington.edu
