        <revremark>A typo was fixed.  The document title was fixed.
                   The instruction for building/installing the ATLAS-based CLAPAC has been commented out since it was not necessary.

      The SPK core library uses a few linear algebra routines from the
BLAS and from the small subset of C LAPACK standard implemented by the ATLAS project.  
This C implementation
should not be confused with the full C implementation of LAPACK 
that is widely distributed (ex. it is included in RedHat Linux distributions).  
The ATLAS's implementation of C LAPACK has different routine names and 
prototypes from the CLAPACK.

ATLAS stands for Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software. ATLAS is both a research project and a software package. This FAQ describes the software package. ATLAS's purpose is to provide portably optimal linear algebra software. The current version provides a complete BLAS API (for both C and Fortran77), and a very small subset of the LAPACK API. For all supported operations, ATLAS achieves performance on par with machine-specific tuned libraries.  (<ulink url="http://www.netlib.org/atlas/">ATLAS homepage</ulink>)

      <title>BLAS</title>
      <para>
The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are high quality "building block" routines for performing basic vector and matrix operations. Level 1 BLAS do vector-vector operations, Level 2 BLAS do matrix-vector operations, and Level 3 BLAS do matrix-matrix operations.  (<ulink url="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS homepage</ulink>)

      <title>LAPACK</title>
      <para>
LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. The associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided, as are related computations such as reordering of the Schur factorizations and estimating condition numbers. Dense and banded matrices are handled, but not general sparse matrices. In all areas, similar functionality is provided for real and complex matrices, in both single and double precision.

    <title>Preparation</title>
    <para>
    The SPK core library uses a few linear algebra routines from the BLAS and the small subset 
of C LAPACK standard implemented by the ATLAS project.  The full LAPACK library is
implemented by CLAPACK as well.  However, we want the two LAPACK implementations to co-exist
peacefully.  The two have different interfaces. We use both implementations because:
1) the SPK core library needs only a few functions from the standard, which is covered by the ATLAS's,
2) the ATLAS's functions directly take column major order matrices, which 
keeps our code clean & simple & efficient, but
3) unfortunately the optimizer later developed by Brad uses eigen value functions
which are not yet implemented by ATLAS but provided by CLAPACK.
So, in our source code files, we would like to be able to include their headers 
(something) like this:
      <screen>
extern "C"{
  // ATLAS interfaces
  #include &lt;atlas/cblas.h&gt;
  #include &lt;atlas/clapack.h&gt;

  // Standard/widely-distributed CLAPACK interfaces
  #include &lt;f2c.h&gt;
  #include &lt;blaswrap.h&gt;
  #include &lt;clapack.h&gt;
}
      </screen>

          specifying a target, <literal>config</literal> which takes an 
          argument that tells the system which ANSII C compiler to use.
          Enter the following:
            <screen>
make config CC=gcc
            </screen>
          The size of a display page will be asked.  Type in an appropriate value.

   Enter number at top left of screen [0]: &lt;your answer&gt;

          Say "yes" to the following three questions unless you strongly disagree:

Have you scoped the errata file? [y]: y
Are you ready to continue? [y]: y
use express setup? [y]: y
            </screen>
          A information gathering process will begin.  
          At the end, you will be asked if you want to proceed
          with the values that are automatically collected.  Inspect
          the values displayed on screen and let it proceed in building
          (note: they use "installation" to mean "build") the libraries
          unless you find something obviously wrong.
          If you have said "no" to the last question "use express setup?", 
          you'd be prompted to answer to the questions like these:

Configuration completed successfully.  You may want to examine the make include
file (Make.Linux_P4) for accuracy before starting the install with the command:

          The value of <literal>arch</literal> at the last line above reflects
          the architecture of your installing machine.  Thus, the actual value

          <para>
          Come up with a value that best describes your architecture and
          set it as a shell variable.  For the sake of demonstration, I will
          use <literal>LinuxRH9_P4</literal> to describe RedHat Linux 9.0 on Pentium 4.

          assignment is arbitrary.  If you want to change it to something else,

          If gcc failed to find the libraries, that's probably
          because <literal>/usr/local/lib</literal> is not in the linker's
          normal search path.  You can fix this problem by including the
          library directory in the searc path.  Enter the following
          from the terminal.
