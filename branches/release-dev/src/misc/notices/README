The notices directory contains the licensing "boiler-plate" that
should start each source file.  It contains the following:

notice.c	: preamble for source file in c
notice.cpp	: preamble for source file in c++
notice.java	: preamble for source file in java
notice.pl	: preamble for source file in perl
notice.sh	: preamble for source file in Bourne/Bash shell

Do not edit any of the files listed above.

Instead, edit notice.txt, then run the shell script,
mknotices.sh to generate the others.

Similarly, only 

	README
	notice.txt
	mknotices.sh

should be in CVS.
